# Oracle Parser — Single Source of Truth

The Oracle parser converts MTGJSON Oracle text into typed `AbilityDefinition` structs that the engine executes. This skill is the **authoritative reference** for all parser work.

> **CR Verification Rule:** Every CR number you write MUST be verified by grepping `docs/MagicCompRules.txt` BEFORE adding it to code. See Section 8.

---

## 1. Non-Negotiable Rules

These rules are defined in CLAUDE.md and are enforced without exception. Violations will be caught in review and must be fixed before merge.

### ⚠ RULE ZERO: Nom Combinators Are Mandatory — No Exceptions

**All new parser code MUST use nom combinators from the very first line written.** This is the single most important rule in the parser codebase. It has been violated repeatedly and is now enforced as a hard gate.

**NEVER write any of these for parsing dispatch:**
- `find()`, `split_once()`, `contains()`, `starts_with()` — for dispatch routing
- `if lower.starts_with("destroy ")` — use `tag("destroy ").parse(lower)` instead
- `if lower.contains("target")` — use `scan_at_word_boundaries` or a nom combinator instead
- `text.find(' ').map(|i| &text[..i])` — use nom `take_till` or `take_while`

**ALWAYS write:**
- `tag("destroy ").parse(lower)?` — for known prefix dispatch
- `alt((tag("destroy "), tag("exile "))).parse(lower)?` — for multi-option dispatch
- `nom_on_lower(text, lower, parser_fn)` — for mixed-case text bridging to nom
- `nom_on_lower_required(text, lower, parser_fn)?` — same with `?` propagation
- `nom_parse_lower(lower, parser_fn)` — when remainder is unused
- `scan_at_word_boundaries(text, combinator)` — for multi-position phrase matching

**Nom combinator reference:** See `nom_combinators.md` in this skill directory for the complete list of nom parsers and combinators organized by module. Consult this when choosing which combinator to use.

**Copy-paste patterns + the enforcement gate:** When you need to translate a string-method idiom into combinators, open `crates/engine/src/parser/oracle_nom/PATTERNS.md` — it indexes every common shape (strip prefix, strip suffix, optional trailing clause, alternatives, word-boundary scan, delimiter split, contains-check, peek-without-consume) with copy-pasteable code. The pre-commit hook `scripts/check-parser-combinators.sh` actively rejects new lines containing `.strip_prefix(...)`, `.strip_suffix(...)`, `.contains("...")`, `.starts_with("...")`, `.ends_with("...")`, `.split_once(...)`, `.find("...")`, or `.trim_end_matches("...")` against string literals inside `crates/engine/src/parser/`. If a use is genuinely structural (post-tokenization punctuation cleanup, `TextPair` dual-string stripping, runtime char scans) annotate the line `// allow-noncombinator: <one-line reason>` per PATTERNS.md §9. Existing offenders are grandfathered; new code is gated.

**The only acceptable uses of `starts_with`/`strip_prefix` in parser code:**
- `TextPair::strip_prefix` for dual-string case-bridging operations (this is structural, not dispatch)
- Runtime array loops or char-level scanners
- Dynamic (non-literal) prefixes that can't be known at compile time

**If you catch yourself writing string matching for parsing, STOP and rewrite with combinators before proceeding.** There is no "convert later" — write it correctly the first time. This rule exists because every past violation required a review round-trip to fix.

**Example — the wrong way vs. the right way:**

```rust
// ❌ WRONG — string matching for dispatch
fn try_parse_destroy(lower: &str) -> Option<Effect> {
    if lower.starts_with("destroy ") {
        let rest = &lower["destroy ".len()..];
        // ... parse target from rest
    }
    None
}

// ✅ RIGHT — nom combinator from the first line
fn try_parse_destroy(lower: &str) -> Option<Effect> {
    let (rest, _) = tag("destroy ").parse(lower).ok()?;
    // ... parse target from rest using parse_target_phrase(rest)
}
```

**See:** `oracle_casting.rs` for verb dispatch via `tag().parse()`, `oracle_trigger.rs` for `alt()` dispatch.

### Other Non-Negotiable Rules

Each rule below is defined in CLAUDE.md. One-sentence principle + codebase example.

| Rule | Example Location |
|------|-----------------|
| **Never match verbatim Oracle text** — decompose every phrase into typed building blocks (grammar + helpers + enums). A verbatim string match handles exactly one card and poisons the architecture. | Contrast: typed `QuantityRef`/`Comparator` vs. literal string |
| **Compose combinators by dimension** — N independent axes = a sum of per-axis `alt()`/`opt()` calls inside one sequence, never a flat `alt` of full-string `tag`s (the product). Variation in the *middle* or an *optional* segment still factors: `recognize((tag(..), alt(..), tag(..), opt(..), tag(..)))`. Smell: a flat `alt` whose arms share a long common prefix **and** suffix. | `oracle_nom/condition.rs` multi-axis composition; PATTERNS.md §8b |
| **Nest by prefix dispatch** — shared prefixes use `preceded(tag(...), sub_combinator)` to eliminate redundant matching. | `oracle_trigger.rs` phase trigger nesting |
| **Word-boundary scanning** — try a combinator at each word boundary via scanning loop, not `contains()` chains. | `oracle_casting.rs::scan_timing_restrictions`, `oracle_trigger.rs::scan_for_phase` |
| **`parse_inner_condition` is the single authority** for all game-state conditions. Trigger/static parsers MUST delegate to it. | `oracle_nom/condition.rs::parse_inner_condition` |
| **No boolean flags** — parameterize with typed enums (`ControllerRef`, `Comparator`, `Option<T>`). | `types/ability.rs` effect variants |
| **No raw `i32` for amounts** — use `QuantityExpr` on all new effects. | `QuantityExpr::Fixed` vs `QuantityExpr::Ref` |
| **Separate abstraction layers** — `QuantityRef` contains only dynamic references. Constants belong in `QuantityExpr::Fixed`. | `QuantityExpr` wrapping `QuantityRef` |
| **`parse_number` vs `parse_number_or_x`** — use `_or_x` when X resolves to 0 (costs, P/T, counters). Use `parse_number` when X should remain as `Variable("X")` (effect quantities). | `oracle_nom/primitives.rs` |
| **All imports at file top** — never inline `use nom::*` inside function bodies. | Project-wide convention |
| **CR annotations mandatory** — with grep verification. See Section 8. | `docs/MagicCompRules.txt` |

### Self-Review Checklist

Ask these four questions after every parser change:

1. Did I duplicate logic that an existing helper already handles?
2. Is this inline extraction something that should use a shared building block?
3. Would this logic work for 50 cards, or just the one I'm looking at?
4. Did I extend the general pattern, or write a special case?

If any answer is wrong, **stop and refactor before moving on.**

## 2. Architecture Overview

### Parse Pipeline — Document-Level Two-Phase (parse → IR → lower)

`parse_oracle_text()` (oracle.rs, near the bottom of the file) is the public
entry point and a **thin wrapper** over two phases: `parse_oracle_ir()` (IR
production) followed by `lower_oracle_ir()` (IR lowering). Diagnostics flow
through `OracleDocIr.diagnostics` → `ParsedAbilities.parse_warnings`.

The document IR is **source-addressed**: every item carries a stable
`OracleItemId` and an `OracleUnitSource` (byte + line span), and items are
emitted in **Oracle source order** — not category order. This is what makes the
CR 707.9a printed-ability slot (`"except it has this ability"`) bind to the right
ability, and it is why preprocessor-emitted items (Saga chapters, Spacecraft
thresholds) no longer jump ahead of main-loop items.

```
Oracle text (from MTGJSON)

parse_oracle_ir()               — oracle.rs: the priority router (see §3)

    │                                   node: OracleNodeIr }>  — SOURCE ORDER
    │   .relations   Vec<DocumentRelationIr>  — closed, cross-item producer→
    │                consumer facts keyed by exact OracleItemId (never inferred
    │                by scanning lowered shapes)
    │   .diagnostics Vec<OracleDiagnostic>
    ↓
lower_oracle_ir()               — oracle.rs: exhaustive match on each OracleNodeIr,
    ↓                             iterating source-ordered items; applies relations
    ↓                             BY ID. Folds into the grouped runtime type:
ParsedAbilities                 — abilities / triggers / statics / replacements /
                                  keywords / casting options + parse_warnings
```

**`OracleSourceSpan` precision** (`doc.rs`) is typed, and honest about what it knows:

| `SpanPrecision` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Exact` | Card-absolute byte + line range. Every document item carries this. |
| `ChainRelative` | Byte range is exact *within one effect chain*, not card-absolute (the document allocator is not yet threaded through `ParseContext`). The verbatim `fragment` is retained so a later unit can upgrade it. Minted by `ClauseIrBuilder` for per-clause provenance. **U5 debt — the last non-card-absolute tier.** |

A renderer must consult `is_exact()` before printing a `first_line`/`start_byte` as a card
position: a `ChainRelative` offset is truthful, but only relative to its chain. `carries_fragment()`
is the single authority for whether a tier may report a verbatim fragment, and
`check_fragment_precision()` enforces the coupling **both ways** (fail-closed) — a tier that cannot
locate a unit must not hand a renderer the whole card as "the offending clause". The retired
`WholeDocument` tier was that case; there is no longer any span that does not locate its unit.

> **The builder is the ordering authority, not the call order.** `OracleDocBuilder` keys items by
> `(first_line, ordinal_within_span)` and re-sorts, so *emission order is irrelevant* — a
> preprocessor may emit a later line before the dispatch loop reaches an earlier one and the
> document still comes out in source order (`builder_returns_items_in_source_order_regardless_of_emission_order`).
> **To perturb item order you must perturb the span, never the sequence of `emit` calls.** Any
> parity probe that reorders calls instead of spans will come back falsely green.

**Cross-item relations — `DocumentRelationIr`** (closed enum, `doc.rs`). Each variant names one
exact producer `OracleItemId` and one exact consumer `OracleItemId`, is bound at parse time, and
**fails closed on ambiguity** rather than pairing by adjacency or by scanning lowered shapes:

- `EtbExileLtbReturn` — CR 607.1 linked exile/return pairs (Oblivion Ring, Fiend Hunter).
- `ActivePlayerPunisher` — CR 102.1 + CR 608.2c coerce/punisher rebinding (Siren's Call).
- `LinkedChoice` — CR 607.2d "choose a [value]" → "the chosen [value]". **One parameterized
  variant**, not three siblings: the producer is always the `choose` clause; the variants differ
  only in `ChosenValueKind` (what is chosen) and `LinkedChoiceBinding` (which consumer surface
  reads it back). A fourth linked-choice shape must be a new enum *value*, never a new relation
  variant.

Per-line classification inside `parse_oracle_ir` (simplified; §3 has the full slot table):

```
    ├─ Keywords-only            → keyword extraction
    ├─ "When/Whenever/At"       → parse_trigger_line()        [oracle_trigger.rs]
    ├─ Contains ":"             → activated ability parsing     [oracle_cost.rs + oracle_effect/]
    ├─ is_static_pattern()      → parse_static_line()          [oracle_classifier.rs → oracle_static/]
    ├─ is_replacement_pattern() → parse_replacement_line()     [oracle_classifier.rs → oracle_replacement.rs]
    ├─ Imperative verb          → parse_effect_chain()         [oracle_effect/]
    ├─ dispatch_line_nom()      → parse_effect_chain_with_context() [oracle_dispatch.rs → oracle_effect/]
    └─ Fallback                 → Effect::Unimplemented
```

### IR Layer — `oracle_ir/`

| Sub-module | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ast.rs` | All parser AST types (`ParsedEffectClause`, `ClauseAst`, modal/loyalty AST — moved here from `oracle_effect/types.rs`, `oracle_modal.rs`, `oracle.rs`) |
| `doc.rs` | Document-level IR: `OracleDocIr`, `OracleItemIr`, `OracleNodeIr`, `OracleItemId`, `OracleUnitSource`, `OracleSourceSpan`/`SpanPrecision`, `DocumentRelationIr`, `OracleDocBuilder`, `PrintedTriggerIndex` |
| `context.rs` | `ParseContext` for stateful parsing (subject, actor, card_name, host_self_reference, …) |
| `diagnostic.rs` | `OracleDiagnostic` — structured parse warnings |
| `effect_chain.rs` | `EffectChainIr`, `ClauseIr` + **typed clause provenance** (`ClauseId`, `ClauseDisposition`, antecedents, reference uses) and the mandatory `ClauseIrBuilder` |
| `trigger.rs` | `TriggerIr` + lowering |
| `static_ir.rs` | `StaticIr` + lowering |
| `replacement.rs` | `ReplacementIr` + lowering |

### Clause Provenance — `ClauseIr` (`oracle_ir/effect_chain.rs`)

A clause does not just carry *what* it does; it carries *where it came from* and *how it relates
to the clause before it*. This is what replaced the old post-lowering tree-scan repairs.

Every `ClauseIr` carries a stable `ClauseId`, an `OracleUnitSource`, its declared antecedents, its
reference uses, and **exactly one** `ClauseDisposition`:

| `ClauseDisposition` | Meaning (CR 608.2c: later text may modify earlier text) |
|---|---|
| `Emit` | Ordinary clause — emit it. |
| `Continue { antecedent, continuation }` | Continues a named earlier instruction (search → destination, reveal → rider). |
| `BranchOtherwise { antecedent }` | The `else` branch of a named earlier instruction. |
| `ReplaceMeaning { antecedent }` | Re-interprets a named earlier instruction. |
| `Absorb { antecedent }` | Folded into a named earlier instruction. |

**All `ClauseIr` construction goes through `ClauseIrBuilder`.** There is no `Default`, and no public
struct literal — missing identity or provenance is a **compile error**, not a silent `None`. The gate
is `rg 'ClauseIr \{'`, which may match only the struct declaration and the builder's single internal
construction.

> **Antecedents are named, never searched.** When two compatible producers exist, the parser names
> the antecedent by `ClauseId`/`AntecedentId` or target slot. The assembler must **never** choose by
> searching the lowered tree for the nearest matching `Effect` variant. That search *was* the bug.

### Effect-Chain Assembly — `oracle_effect/assembly.rs`

`assemble_effect_chain(&EffectChainIr) -> AbilityDefinition` is the **single source-order assembly
traversal**. It owns an arena of output nodes plus an `AssemblyEnv`, so an earlier node can be
amended by an explicitly-bound later continuation without recursively walking a partially-built tree.

Parsed IR is **immutable** during assembly; the assembler owns the mutable output nodes and the typed
environment. Final materialization (arena links → `Box<AbilityDefinition>`) is mechanical and contains
no semantic pattern matching.

**The arena is keyed by node index, not by `ClauseId`.** A `ClauseId` names a *parsed clause*, but a
continuation may push an output node that no clause owns (a search destination, a rest-destination
patch), so a `ClauseId`-only key cannot address every amendable node. `Arena { nodes: Vec<ArenaNode> }`
therefore addresses nodes by position, and `AssemblyEnv` carries a **typed role registry per
amendable class** — `conditional_nodes`, `optional_head_nodes`, `search_destination_nodes`,
`dig_or_reveal_until_nodes`, `destroy_like_nodes`, `face_down_profile_nodes` — each a `Vec<usize>` in
emission order.

They are **lists, not last-only slots**, because a guarded selector may have to walk *past* a
candidate that fails its guard (`BranchOtherwise` skips an optional head that already has a sub).
A binding is then `(AntecedentRole, AntecedentSelector)`: the role names *which class of node* is
being bound, the selector names *which one* (`LastEmitted`, `LastWithRole`, …). The walk is over the
typed candidate list — **never over the output tree**. Scanning the lowered tree for the nearest
matching `Effect` variant is the bug this whole layer exists to delete.

> Roles are deliberately **narrow and non-nested**. `DigOrRevealUntil` (the `RestDestination`
> patchable set) is a *different* set from `DigOrMill` (the `DigFromAmong` anchor) even though both
> contain `Dig`. Widening a role to a superset to save a variant re-opens the nearest-match trap for
> every card in the difference.

> **`lower_effect_chain_ir` (`lower.rs`) is a one-line delegator to `assemble_effect_chain`** —
> a name-preserving wrapper kept so the traversal relocation did not have to touch every call site in
> one commit. It is scaffolding, not an authority. **Do not add logic to it.** The ~30 `pub(super)`
> clause-lowering helpers still live in `lower.rs`; relocating them into `assembly.rs` is a later
> increment, not a settled design.

### Known Milestone-1 debt (do not mistake these for the target architecture)

- **`OracleNodeIr::PreLowered{Spell,Trigger,Static,Replacement}`** still exist (26 references in
  `oracle.rs`). They carry an already-assembled engine type instead of typed IR, and are produced by
  the preprocessors and the complex dispatch paths. Retiring them is **item-granular** work: the
  document already gives every item an `OracleItemId` and an exact span, so what is missing is the
  per-node IR type, not the addressing.
- **`TriggerBody::PreLowered`** still exists, for the **whole-body recognizers**
  (`parse_vote_block`, `parse_separate_into_piles`, `try_parse_inline_modal`, …). These take an
  entire multi-sentence body and refuse to let it be chain-fragmented, so they have no `_ir` sibling.
  Converting them is a genuine bring-up (it *changes* lowering), which a parity migration may not
  absorb — **deferred to the recognizer→IR bring-up plan**
  (`.planning/architecture-remediation/05-recognizer-ir-bringup.md`).
- **`SpanPrecision::ChainRelative`** is the last non-card-absolute span tier: `ClauseIrBuilder`'s
  allocator is seeded over the chain text because the document allocator is not yet threaded through
  `ParseContext`. Honest, not fabricated — the fragment is retained so a later unit can upgrade it to
  `Exact`. **This is now the only tier a position renderer must refuse to print as a card position.**
- **Undeclared positional bindings remain outside the effect-chain arena.** 28 `defs.last_mut()`-style
  sites (`sequence.rs` 20, `lower.rs` 4, `assembly.rs` 3, `mod.rs` 1) still bind "the previous thing"
  by position rather than by declared role, plus a handful of clause-stream `.rev()` lookbacks in
  `mod.rs`. Each is a latent mis-binding site of the same species the arena was built to kill.
  **A byte-identity gate cannot validate converting these** — see the warning below.
- **`ChainLoweringMode`** (`oracle_effect/mod.rs`) encodes a deliberate asymmetry: the standalone
  chain entry point runs 8 bypass recognizers, the with-context one runs 9 (it also runs
  `try_parse_exile_pile_shuffle_cloak`). This is **preserved byte-for-byte**, as typed data with an
  exhaustive match. It is suspected-accidental history, but unifying it would silently change lowering
  across the die-roll cards, so it is a post-Milestone-1 follow-up gated on finding a discriminating card.

> **Byte-identity is structurally blind to a narrowed binding.** When the positional walk-backs were
> converted to declared roles, *every* call site turned out to see exactly one candidate on today's
> pool — so `LastEmitted`, `LastWithRole`, and any other nearest-match rule are all output-identical,
> and a full-pool byte-for-byte parity run cannot tell a correct binding from a wrongly-collapsed one.
> Validating a binding change needs a **forced diagonal** (drive the selector to a different candidate
> and confirm the output moves) or a synthetic discriminating card. **Never sign off a binding
> migration on byte-identity alone.**

**Retired in Milestone 1** (do not re-introduce): the category-ordered `parsed_abilities_to_doc_ir`
Class façade and its `SpanPrecision::WholeDocument` span tier — Class is now an ordinary preprocessor
emitting at printed source lines; the four post-lowering shape-repair passes removed in U7; and the
lowered-tree scans replaced by the arena's declared-role bindings.

### Nom Combinator Layer — `oracle_nom/`

All parser branches delegate atomic parsing to shared nom 8.0 combinators:

| Sub-module | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `primitives.rs` | Numbers, mana symbols, colors, counters, P/T, roman numerals, word-boundary guards |
| `target.rs` | Target phrase combinators, controller suffix, combat status |
| `quantity.rs` | Quantity expression combinators, "for each" patterns |
| `duration.rs` | Duration phrase combinators ("until end of turn", etc.) |
| `condition.rs` | Condition phrase combinators ("if", "unless", "as long as") |
| `filter.rs` | Filter property combinators (zone, type, controller, "with") |
| `error.rs` | `OracleError` / `OracleResult` type aliases, `oracle_err` error constructor. Parse-failure authority is `Effect::unimplemented(name, fragment)` (`types/ability.rs`) — never hand-construct `Effect::Unimplemented { .. }` literals |
| `context.rs` | Re-export shim for `ParseContext` (canonical home: `oracle_ir/context.rs`) |
| `bridge.rs` | `nom_on_lower`, `nom_on_lower_required`, `nom_parse_lower` — mixed-case bridging |
| `enchant.rs` | "Enchant {filter}" attachment-restriction combinators |
| `return_as_aura.rs` | "return ~ ... attached to" / return-as-Aura combinators |

### Two-Phase Parse/Lower Architecture (clause level)

Within the effect branch, the parser uses the same two-phase approach at clause
granularity: **parse → AST → lower → Effect**.

```
parse_effect_clause()                    — entry point (oracle_effect/mod.rs)
  → clause_shell::peel_clause()          — strip structural slots first (see below)
  → parse_clause_ast()                   — classify sentence shape → ClauseAst
  → lower_clause_ast()                   — convert AST to Effect
    → lower_subject_predicate_ast()      — for SubjectPredicate clauses
    → lower_imperative_clause()          — for Imperative clauses
      → parse_imperative_effect()        — try special cases, then delegate
        → parse_imperative_family_ast()  — classify verb family (imperative.rs)
        → lower_imperative_family_ast()  — convert to Effect
```

### Clause Shell — Structural Slot Peeling (`clause_shell.rs`)

**This is the destination architecture for structural slots.** Phase 2 of the
no-text-swallowing refactor (see `data/parser-swallow-progress.md`) inverts
slot-consumption responsibility: instead of every body parser recognizing AND
consuming surrounding structural slots inline (and silently dropping them when
it forgets — the swallowing bug class), `peel_clause(text)` recursively strips
slot-bearing prefixes/suffixes off the clause, accumulating them into a
`ClauseContext` (synthesized attributes). The bare imperative remainder is
handed to the existing body parsers, and the context is applied back onto the
parsed result (`apply_optional`, `duration()`, `condition()`), so no recognized
slot can be dropped.

**Slots live in the shell today:**
- **Optional** — `"you may [verb]"` → `ClauseContext.optional` (CR 608.2d), with
  a specialized-phrase blocklist (`is_specialized_you_may_phrase`) for "you may"
  constructions whose dedicated body parsers need the full surface form
  (alt-costs, impulse-draw permission, causative "have", retarget, Dig
  keep-from-among, specialized reveals).
- **Duration** — trailing duration suffix → `ClauseContext.duration`, delegating
  to `strip_trailing_duration` so the suffix table stays single-source (with an
  `is_specialized_duration_carrier` guard for parsers that need the suffix as a
  disambiguation signal, e.g. impulse-draw vs `CastFromZone`).
- **Leading condition** — `"if [cond], [effect]"` → `ClauseContext.condition`,
  delegating to `strip_leading_general_conditional` (which routes through
  `parse_inner_condition`).

**Call site:** `parse_effect_clause()` in `oracle_effect/mod.rs` (single peel
point; `oracle_trigger.rs` and `oracle_effect/subject.rs` reference the peel
in comments where their behavior depends on it). If the peeled variant lands
in `Unimplemented`, the original text is retried — the shell is conservative.

**Rule for new work:** when adding handling for a new *structural* slot type
(durations, optional clauses, conditions, and future siblings like APNAP order
or activation limits), migrate it into the shell rather than adding another
per-callsite `strip_*` pass: add a field on `ClauseContext`, a branch in
`peel_inner`, an `apply_*` method, and remove the linear `strip_*` calls at the
body-parser call sites. Do not add new inline slot consumption to body parsers.

### Parser Dispatch Architecture

- **Nom combinators** handle ALL parsing dispatch — atomic, structural, sentence-level verb dispatch, and top-level routing.
- **`TextPair`** provides dual-string case-bridging (subject-predicate decomposition, clause AST classification). `TextPair::strip_prefix` is correct for these structural operations.
- **`oracle_classifier.rs`** owns reusable line-classification helpers such as trigger-prefix, static-pattern, and replacement-pattern detection. `oracle.rs` remains the priority router that calls them.
- **`oracle_special.rs`** owns the router-adjacent special helpers for solve conditions, Defiler two-line statics, die-roll tables, self-reference normalization for static parsing, and keyword-line parsers like Escape/Harmonize/Cumulative Upkeep.
- **`oracle_effect/conditions.rs`** owns leading-condition splitting and ability-condition helpers. `oracle_effect/mod.rs` remains the clause/effect orchestrator and re-exports `split_leading_conditional`.
- **`oracle_effect/search.rs`** owns search/seek filter parsing helpers. `oracle_effect/mod.rs` re-exports the stable search helper surface used by imperative and continuation parsing.
- **New parser code** MUST use nom combinators. `starts_with`/`strip_prefix` for parsing dispatch is NOT acceptable (see Rule Zero).

---

## 3. Parsing Priority System

Lines in `parse_oracle_ir()` (oracle.rs) are classified slot by slot. **First
match wins — the binding order is the SOURCE ORDER of the slots in the line
loop, NOT the numeric labels.** The labels are historical and non-monotonic
(`8b (early)` runs before `0`; loyalty `11` runs before the `3x` keyword-line
slots). When inserting a new slot, place it by evaluation position and grep
`// Priority` in oracle.rs to see the live order; the table below mirrors that
grep in evaluation order (one row per `// Priority <label>:` comment — the CI
gate `scripts/check-skill-doc.sh` asserts the row count matches the code).

Before the line loop, `parse_oracle_ir` runs **pre-parsers** that consume whole
line ranges: Saga chapters, Attraction visit lines, Class level sections (early
return), Leveler LEVEL blocks, Spacecraft `N+ |` thresholds, and the Strive
cost scan. Consumed line indices are skipped by the loop.

Unlabeled handlers interleaved between labeled slots are shown as `—` rows.

Gates Priority `7`. Returns false for `target`-leading lines, then matches
`STATIC_CONTAINS_PATTERNS` (word-boundary scan: "gets +", "have ", "can't
attack", "nonland ", "you may spend mana as though", …), `STATIC_PREFIX_PATTERNS`,
and `is_static_compound_pattern()` (graveyard/top-of-library/exile cast
permissions, "spells can't be cast", flash grants, …). Check the constants in
`oracle_classifier.rs` for the full lists.

### `is_replacement_pattern()` — `oracle_classifier.rs`
Gates Priority `8`. Matches `REPLACEMENT_CONTAINS_PATTERNS` ("would ",
"prevent all", "enters tapped/untapped/prepared", "enter as a copy of",
"become a copy of"), trailing " enter tapped/untapped", counter-prohibition
phrases (CR 614.17), and `is_replacement_compound_pattern()` (as-enters-choose,
enters/escapes + counter, tapped-for-mana + instead, madness discard).

## 4. Core Concepts

### 4a. Subject Stripping — The Key Design Decision

`strip_subject_clause()` removes subjects like "you", "target creature", "its controller" and recurses on the predicate. This simplifies parsing but **discards semantic information**.

**Rule:** If the subject encodes game-relevant information, intercept with a `try_parse_*` helper *before* stripping.

**When to intercept:** Subject determines WHO is affected, WHAT is referenced, or creates a sentence-internal dependency.
**When stripping is fine:** "You draw three cards" (caster always draws), "Destroy target creature" (target is in verb phrase).

```
"Its controller gains life equal to its power"
    ❌ strip_subject_clause → loses "its controller" → GainLife { player: Controller }  BUG
    ✅ try_parse_targeted_controller_gain_life() → GainLife { player: TargetedController, amount: TargetPower }
```

The `try_parse_*` intercept pattern is used in:
- `try_parse_subject_predicate_ast()` in `subject.rs` — for subject-verb clauses
- `lower_imperative_clause()` in `mod.rs` — for imperative clauses with semantic subjects

### 4b. ClauseAst Type System

Top-level sentence classification — `ClauseAst`:

| Variant | Shape | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `Imperative` | Bare verb, no subject | "draw three cards" |
| `SubjectPredicate` | Subject + verb | "target creature gets +2/+2" |
| `Conditional` | Wrapped conditional | "if you control a creature, draw a card" |

Predicate types — `PredicateAst`:

| Variant | Detected by | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| `Continuous` | "gets/get", "has/have" | "gets +2/+2 and has flying" |
| `Become` | "becomes" | "becomes a 3/3 creature" |
| `Restriction` | "can't", "cannot" | "can't attack or block" |
| `ImperativeFallback` | None of the above | Falls back to imperative parsing |

Imperative family dispatch — `ImperativeFamilyAst` (oracle_ir/ast.rs). The enum
has three layers of variants: direct families, `Structured(ImperativeAst)`
wrapping the structured families (`Numeric`, `Targeted`, `SearchCreation`,
`HandReveal`, `Choose`, `Utility`), and a tail of keyword-action leaves
(`Explore`, `Connive`, `Investigate`, `Learn`, `Manifest`, `Proliferate`,
`Populate`, `Goad`, `RollDie`, `VentureIntoDungeon`, …):

| Family | Sub-parser | Verb patterns |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| `CostResource` | `parse_cost_resource_ast()` | add mana, pay life, deal damage |
| `ZoneCounter` | `parse_zone_counter_ast()` | destroy, exile, counter, put counter |
| `Structured(Numeric)` | `parse_numeric_imperative_ast()` | draw, gain life, lose life, pump, scry, surveil, mill |
| `Structured(Targeted)` | `parse_targeted_action_ast()` | tap, untap, sacrifice, discard, return, fight, gain control |
| `Structured(SearchCreation)` | `parse_search_and_creation_ast()` | search library, dig, create token, copy token |
| `Structured(HandReveal)` | `parse_hand_reveal_ast()` | look at hand, reveal hand, reveal top |
| `Structured(Choose)` | `parse_choose_ast()` | target-only, named choice, reveal hand filter |
| `Structured(Utility)` | `parse_utility_imperative_ast()` | prevent, regenerate, copy, transform, attach |
| `Shuffle` | `parse_shuffle_ast()` | shuffle, shuffle into library |
| `Put` | `parse_put_ast()` | put into/on top of |
| `YouMay` | "you may" prefix | Wraps inner effect (generic optionals are peeled earlier by `clause_shell`) |

Approximate dispatch order in `parse_imperative_family_ast()`: keyword-grant
intercepts → CostResource → ZoneCounter → Numeric → Targeted → SearchCreation →
Utility → Shuffle → HandReveal → Choose → keyword-action leaves → Put → YouMay.
Read the function for the binding order before inserting a new family.

### 4c. Clause Splitting & Continuations

`split_clause_sequence(text)` splits multi-sentence text on `.` (Sentence), `, then` (Then), and certain `,` boundaries. Respects parentheses and possessive apostrophes.

**Continuation absorption** — a follow-up clause modifies a preceding effect:

| Pattern | Continuation | What it does |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Search → "put into your hand" | `SearchDestination` | Appends ChangeZone sub_ability |
| RevealHand → "choose a nonland card" | `RevealHandFilter` | Patches card filter |
| Mana → "spend this mana only..." | `ManaRestriction` | Patches spend restriction |
| Counter → "that spell loses all abilities" | `CounterSourceStatic` | Patches source_static |
| Token → "suspect it" | `SuspectLastCreated` | Appends Suspect sub_ability |

Key functions: `parse_followup_continuation_ast()`, `parse_intrinsic_continuation_ast()`, `continuation_absorbs_current()`, `apply_clause_continuation()` — all in `oracle_effect/sequence.rs`.

### 4d. QuantityExpr / QuantityRef

```rust
pub enum QuantityExpr {
    Ref { qty: QuantityRef },   // dynamic — resolved from game state at runtime
    Fixed { value: i32 },       // literal constant
}
```

`QuantityRef` contains ONLY dynamic references (HandSize, LifeTotal, ObjectCount, TargetPower, Variable, etc.). Constants belong in `QuantityExpr::Fixed` — never put `Fixed(i32)` inside `QuantityRef`.

| Oracle phrase | Mapping |
|---------------|---------|
| "3 damage" | `QuantityExpr::Fixed { value: 3 }` |
| "damage equal to its power" | `QuantityExpr::Ref { qty: TargetPower }` |
| "X damage" | `QuantityExpr::Ref { qty: Variable { name: "X" } }` |
| "for each creature you control" | `QuantityExpr::Ref { qty: ObjectCount { filter } }` |

### 4e. Self-Reference Normalization

Before parsing, `normalize_self_refs()` replaces the card's name and phrases like "this creature" with `~`. The canonical phrase list lives in `oracle_util.rs` as `SELF_REF_TYPE_PHRASES` — update the constant, not each consumer.

`parse_target()` handles both `~` and type phrases → `TargetFilter::SelfRef` automatically. Any parser function checking self-references gets this for free via `parse_target`.

```

AST type definitions (`ClauseAst`, `ImperativeFamilyAst`, `ParsedEffectClause`,
etc.) live in `oracle_ir/ast.rs` — the former `oracle_effect/types.rs` was
moved there as part of the IR layer.

### Subject-Predicate Parsing — `subject.rs`

`try_parse_subject_predicate_ast()` parses sentences with explicit subjects.

Subject resolution via `parse_subject_application()`:

| Subject text | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| "target creature" | Explicit target with TargetFilter |
| "all creatures", "each creature" | Mass filter |
| "~", "it", "this creature" | SelfRef |
| "enchanted creature" | EnchantedCreature |
| "equipped creature" | EquippedCreature |
| "defending player" | DefendingPlayer |
| "creatures you control" | Typed filter with controller: You |

Predicate hierarchy: `try_parse_subject_continuous_clause()` → `try_parse_subject_become_clause()` → `try_parse_subject_restriction_clause()` → fallback to `strip_subject_clause()` + imperative.

### Imperative Family Verb Patterns

**Numeric** (`parse_numeric_imperative_ast`): draw N, gain N life, lose N life, gets +X/+Y, scry N, surveil N, mill N. Also used by `try_parse_for_each_effect()` via `with_for_each_quantity()`.

**ZoneCounter** (`parse_zone_counter_ast`): destroy target/all, exile target/all, counter target spell, put N counters on target (delegates to `counter.rs`), remove N counters.

**Targeted** (`parse_targeted_action_ast`): tap/untap target, sacrifice, discard N, return to hand/battlefield, fight, gain control of.

**CostResource** (`parse_cost_resource_ast`): add {mana} (delegates to `mana.rs`), pay N life, pay {mana}, deal damage.

**SearchCreation** (`parse_search_and_creation_ast`): search your library, look at top N (dig), create token (delegates to `token.rs`), token copy.

**Token** (`token.rs`): Parses count → P/T → supertypes → colors → types → name → keywords → "where X is" expressions.

**Animation** (`animation.rs`): Parses "becomes a 3/3 [colors] [types] [keywords]" → `AnimationSpec` → `Vec<ContinuousModification>`.

**Counter** (`counter.rs`): `try_parse_put_counter`, `try_parse_remove_counter`, `try_parse_move_counters`, `try_parse_multiply_counter`, `try_parse_double_effect`.

**Mana** (`mana.rs`): `try_parse_add_mana_effect` (fixed symbols, colorless, any color, chosen color), `parse_mana_spend_restriction`, `try_parse_activate_only_condition`.

### Compound Action Detection — `mod.rs`

- `try_split_targeted_compound()` — "verb target X and verb2 it": uses `parse_target()` remainder to find split, inherits parent target via `replace_target_with_parent()`
- `try_parse_compound_shuffle()` — "shuffle X and Y into libraries": two ChangeZone effects
- `try_parse_for_each_effect()` — "draw a card for each creature": delegates to `parse_numeric_imperative_ast()` + `with_for_each_quantity()` + `thread_for_each_subject()`
- `parse_damage_player_scope()` / `parse_damage_each_player_scope()` — shared damage-player routing helpers. Use these for exact `each player` / `each opponent` / `each foe` damage phrases before falling back to `DamageAll`. Keep this semantic split in `oracle_effect/mod.rs`; do not push it into `parse_target()`, which remains object/filter-oriented.

### Special-Case Matchers in `parse_effect_clause()`

| Matcher | Pattern | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `try_parse_damage_prevention_disabled()` | "damage can't be prevented" | GenericEffect + DamagePreventionDisabled |
| `try_parse_still_a_type()` | "it's still a land" | GenericEffect + AddType |
| `try_parse_for_each_effect()` | "draw a card for each creature" | Numeric AST + for-each quantity |
| `try_parse_equal_to_quantity_effect()` | "mill cards equal to hand size" | Effect with QuantityExpr |

| `oracle_classifier.rs` | Shared line-classification helpers: trigger prefixes (`has_trigger_prefix`), **`is_static_pattern()` (~line 398)**, **`is_replacement_pattern()`**, granted-static and vehicle-tier detection. Called by `oracle.rs`, `oracle_dispatch.rs`, and class parsing. | Gates for `5-6`, `7`, `8`, `13c` |
| `oracle_dispatch.rs` | Nom fallback dispatch for effect/static/replacement candidates before `Unimplemented`. | `14a` |
| `clause_shell.rs` | Structural-slot peeling (`peel_clause` / `ClauseContext`) — see §2. Destination for all new structural slot handling (optional, duration, leading condition today). | Inside `parse_effect_clause()` |
| `oracle_special.rs` | Router-adjacent helpers for solve conditions, Defiler two-line statics, die-roll tables, static self-ref normalization, and keyword-line parsing (Escape/Harmonize/Cumulative Upkeep). | `3b`, `6c-defiler`, die-roll slot |

| `oracle_static/` | **Directory** — static ability parsing split into submodules (see below). Entry: `parse_static_line()` / `parse_static_line_multi()` in `mod.rs` / `shared.rs`, internally two-phase (`parse_static_line_ir` → `lower_static_ir`). | `7` |
| `oracle_replacement.rs` | Replacement effects: priority-ordered pattern matching (as-enters-choose before shock-land before fast-land, etc.), builder pattern with `ReplacementDefinition::new()`. | `8`, `5-pre` |
| `oracle_condition.rs` | Restriction conditions: source/control/graveyard/hand/event conditions for "Cast only if..." / "Activate only if..." patterns. | Used by `4` and casting-restriction lines |
| `oracle_cost.rs` | Ability cost parsing: mana costs, tap/sacrifice/discard costs, `parse_single_cost()` for individual cost components. | `4` |
| `oracle_keyword.rs` | Keyword extraction: comma-separated keyword lists, parameterized keywords (ward, kicker), keyword grants. | `0`, `1b`, `13` + keyword-cost slots |
| `oracle_casting.rs` | Casting options/restrictions: additional costs ("As an additional cost"), alternative costs, timing restrictions (flash, sorcery speed), `scan_timing_restrictions()`. | `8b (early)` + casting-restriction slot |
| `oracle_modal.rs` | Modal spell parsing: "Choose N" headers, bullet mode collection, `parse_oracle_block()` for block-level parsing. | `1` |
| `oracle_vote.rs` | Council's-dilemma / Will-of-the-Council vote blocks (CR 701.38): "each player votes for A or B" + per-vote effects. | Within `9` and trigger bodies |
| `oracle_separate_piles.rs` | Pile-separation shape (CR 700.3): "separates ... into two piles" three-sentence form. | Within `9` |
| `oracle_class.rs` | Class card parsing (level-gated abilities). | Special pre-parse |
| `oracle_level.rs` | Leveler card parsing (LEVEL N-M power/toughness ranges). | Special pre-parse |

| `oracle_spacecraft.rs` | Spacecraft pipe-delimited threshold lines "N+ \| body" → charge-counter-gated statics/triggers/abilities (CR 721). | Special pre-parse |

### The `oracle_static/` Directory Split

The former single-file `oracle_static.rs` is now a directory. `mod.rs` owns the
public `parse_static_line()` (two-phase: `parse_static_line_ir` →
`lower_static_ir`), a shared `prelude`, and the re-export surface. Submodules:

| Sub-module | What lives here |
|-----------|----------------|
| `dispatch.rs` | `parse_static_line_inner` — the priority-ordered static-pattern dispatch |
| `shared.rs` | `parse_static_line_multi`, compound-line splitting, cross-submodule helpers |
| `anthem.rs` | P/T modification statics: "get +1/+1", dynamic/base P/T, "where X is" binding |
| `keyword_grant.rs` | Keyword/ability grants: `parse_continuous_modifications()`, quoted-ability grants, graveyard keyword grants |
| `evasion.rs` | Combat statics: can't-block/attack splits, block exceptions, must-attack |
| `restriction.rs` | Casting/activation prohibitions: `strip_casting_prohibition_subject()`, cast-and-activate-only-during |
| `cost_mod.rs` | Cost modification statics: alternative costs, cost payment prohibitions |
| `type_change.rs` | Type-changing statics: "is a", "becomes", additive type clauses |
| `cda.rs` | Characteristic-defining abilities |
| `grammar.rs` | Shared static-line grammar combinators |
| `static_helpers.rs` | Misc static construction helpers |
| `loyalty.rs` | Loyalty-related static helpers |
| `mana_transform.rs` | Mana-type transformation statics (retain-unspent-mana, etc.) |

### Event-Context References

`parse_event_context_ref()` in `oracle_target.rs` handles trigger-event anaphoric references:

| Oracle phrase | TargetFilter variant |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "that spell's controller" | `TriggeringSpellController` |
| "that player" | `TriggeringPlayer` |
| "that source" / "that permanent" | `TriggeringSource` |
| "defending player" | `DefendingPlayer` |

**Must be checked BEFORE standard `parse_target()` for trigger-based effects.**

### The Possessive vs. Targeting Fork

**Critical decision point — silent failure when wrong:**

```
"Look at your hand"              → contains_possessive → target: Controller
"Look at target opponent's hand" → parse_target → target: Typed { controller: Opponent }
```

- Possessive forms that fall to `parse_target` → no target found → `Unimplemented`
- Targeting forms matched by `contains_possessive` → targeting phase skipped → wrong player affected

## 7. Building Block Reference

**Search these modules BEFORE writing any new utility.** Duplicating what already exists is a defect.

| `oracle_nom/filter.rs` | Zone filters, controller filters, property filters ("tapped", "attacking", "with flying", "with a +1/+1 counter") | Parsing object property constraints |
| `oracle_nom/error.rs` | `OracleError` / `OracleResult` type aliases, `oracle_err` (error constructor for hand-rolled combinators). For "parser couldn't handle this", use `Effect::unimplemented(name, fragment)` from `types/ability.rs` — the single authority; literal `Effect::Unimplemented { .. }` construction is gated for new code | Error handling at parser dispatch boundaries |
| `oracle_nom/bridge.rs` | `nom_on_lower` (run nom on lowercase, map consumed bytes back to original-case remainder), `nom_on_lower_required` (Result variant), `nom_parse_lower` (discard remainder) | Bridging mixed-case Oracle text to lowercase nom combinators |
| `oracle_nom/context.rs` | `ParseContext` (subject, quantity_ref, card_name, in_trigger, in_replacement) | Threading parse state across combinator boundaries |
| `oracle_util.rs` | `TextPair` (dual original/lowercase slices with `strip_prefix`/`strip_suffix`), `parse_number` wrapper, mana symbol parsing, `strip_reminder_text`, `normalize_card_name_refs`, possessive/pronoun matching (`contains_possessive`, `contains_object_pronoun`, `starts_with_possessive`), `match_phrase_variants`, `merge_or_filters`, `SELF_REF_TYPE_PHRASES`, `SELF_REF_PARSE_ONLY_PHRASES` | Case-bridging structural ops, shared string utilities, phrase matching |
| `oracle_target.rs` | `parse_target` (full target extraction), `parse_type_phrase` (type descriptions without "target"), `parse_player_reference`, `parse_event_context_ref`, `parse_zone_suffix` | High-level target/filter extraction from Oracle text |
| `oracle_quantity.rs` | **Frozen legacy fall-through** — `parse_quantity_ref` (semantic interpretation), `parse_cda_quantity` (CDAs), `parse_for_each_clause` ("for each [filter]") | Existing call sites only. Do NOT add new `QuantityRef` recognition here — it goes in `oracle_nom/quantity.rs` (see doctrine below) |

### Where New Grammar Goes — Single-Authority Doctrine

Each grammar axis has exactly one home for NEW pattern recognition. Adding a
pattern anywhere else creates a second authority that will drift:

- **Durations** — one grammar. Two duration tables exist today:
  `oracle_nom/duration.rs::parse_duration` (the nom combinator grammar) and
  `oracle_effect/lower.rs::strip_trailing_duration` (+ `strip_leading_duration`)
  — the suffix/prefix tables that the clause shell and the static/effect
  parsers actually run against, and the richer of the two ("for the rest of
  the game", "until ~ leaves the battlefield", mid-clause durations).
  Consolidation into `oracle_nom/duration.rs` is planned; **until that port
  happens, new duration patterns go in `strip_trailing_duration`'s table in
  `oracle_effect/lower.rs`** (and `strip_leading_duration` for leading forms),
  so the clause shell picks them up for free. Do not add a third recognizer.
- **`QuantityRef` recognition** — new dynamic-quantity phrases go in
  `oracle_nom/quantity.rs` (`parse_quantity_ref` combinator and friends),
  never in `oracle_quantity.rs`, which is frozen legacy fall-through.
- **Type phrases / targets** — new type-phrase and target work composes the
  `oracle_nom/target.rs` combinators. `oracle_target.rs` remains the
  high-level extraction surface, but its building blocks are the nom
  combinators — extend those, not bespoke string logic.
- **Conditions** — `parse_inner_condition` in `oracle_nom/condition.rs` is the
  single condition recognizer (output type: `StaticCondition`). Its output is
  adapted into other condition layers by three bridges that MUST be kept
  exhaustive when `StaticCondition` gains variants:
  `static_condition_to_trigger_condition` (`oracle_trigger.rs`),
  `static_condition_to_ability_condition` (`oracle_effect/conditions.rs`), and
  `static_condition_to_restriction_condition` (`oracle_condition.rs`). A new
  `StaticCondition` variant that is silently unconvertible in a bridge is a
  swallow bug waiting to surface.
- **Structural slots** (optional, duration, leading condition, future siblings)
  — `clause_shell.rs` (see §2). New slot types migrate into the shell.

**Damage-player routing** (`oracle_effect/mod.rs`) — exact player-set phrases in damage effects have a dedicated helper path:

| Helper | Purpose | Use When |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `parse_damage_player_scope()` | Parse the player noun for damage phrases: `player`, `opponent`, `foe` | Reusing the noun parse across simple and compound damage clauses |
| `parse_damage_each_player_scope()` | Parse exact `each player/opponent/foe` with punctuation-only tails allowed | Routing `DealDamage` text to `DamageEachPlayer` instead of `DamageAll` |

Rule: if the Oracle text is a damage effect that names a set of players, resolve that at the effect layer with these helpers. Do not teach `parse_target()` that `each opponent` is a player-damage target, because that would blur the object-target/filter boundary and reintroduce object-vs-player bugs.

### Sub-Ability Chains & Target Propagation

`parse_effect_chain()` splits on `. ` boundaries and links clauses as `sub_ability`. At runtime, `resolve_ability_chain()` walks the chain. When a parent ability has targets but the sub-ability does not, targets propagate automatically. Sub-abilities do NOT need their own target lists.

---

## 8. CR Annotation Protocol

**MANDATORY for any code implementing MTG game rules. Non-optional.**

### Verification — Before Writing ANY CR Number

```bash
# REQUIRED — run these BEFORE writing the annotation:
grep -n "^701.21" docs/MagicCompRules.txt   # Verify keyword action number
grep -n "^702.122" docs/MagicCompRules.txt  # Verify keyword ability number
grep -n "^704.5a" docs/MagicCompRules.txt   # Verify SBA rule
```

**If you cannot find the rule number, do NOT write the annotation.** Flag it as "needs manual verification" instead. 701.x and 702.x numbers are arbitrary sequential assignments — LLMs consistently hallucinate them.

**A wrong CR number is worse than no CR number. It creates false confidence that code was verified against the wrong rule.**

### Format

```rust
// CR 704.5a: A player with 0 or less life loses the game.
/// Checks state-based actions (CR 704).
// CR 702.2c + CR 702.19b: Deathtouch with trample assigns lethal (1).
// CR 704.3 / CR 800.4: SBAs may have ended the game during auto-advance.
```

- Prefix: Always `CR`. Never `Rule`, `MTG Rule`, or bare numbers.
- Description is mandatory — bare `CR 704.5a` with no explanation is not acceptable.
- `+` for interacting rules, `/` for alternative/overlapping rules.
- Only annotate game logic, not boilerplate/plumbing.

## 9. Checklists

### 9a. Adding a New Parser Pattern

**Phase 1 — Identify Where It Belongs**
- Imperative verb/family → the relevant `parse_*_ast()` in `imperative.rs`
- Subject + predicate → `try_parse_subject_*` in `subject.rs`
- Token creation → `token.rs`
- Animation/become → `animation.rs`
- Counter mechanics → `counter.rs`
- Mana production → `mana.rs`
- Continuation/absorption → `sequence.rs`
- Structural slot (optional / duration / leading condition) → `clause_shell.rs` (see §2)
- Duration phrase → `strip_trailing_duration` table in `oracle_effect/lower.rs` (see §7 doctrine)
- Dynamic quantity → `oracle_nom/quantity.rs` (never `oracle_quantity.rs`)
- Trigger → `oracle_trigger.rs`
- Static → `oracle_static/` (dispatch in `dispatch.rs`, category submodules per §6)
- Replacement → `oracle_replacement.rs`
- Routing gate → `is_static_pattern()` / `is_replacement_pattern()` in `oracle_classifier.rs` (~line 398)

**Phase 2 — Add the Pattern**
- [ ] Write the parser test FIRST
- [ ] Use nom combinators from the first line (Rule Zero)
- [ ] Use existing helpers — `parse_target()`, `parse_number()`, `contains_possessive()`, `parse_type_phrase()`
- [ ] More specific patterns go BEFORE more general ones

**Phase 3 — Handle the Subject**
- [ ] Does the subject carry game-relevant info? → add `try_parse_*` interceptor
- [ ] Otherwise, subject stripping is fine

**Phase 4 — Chain Composition**
- [ ] Check continuation system in `sequence.rs`
- [ ] Check `parse_effect_chain()` for special chaining

**Phase 5 — Routing**
- [ ] Update `is_static_pattern()` or `is_replacement_pattern()` in `oracle_classifier.rs` if text is routed to the wrong parser

**Phase 6 — Tests & Verification**
- [ ] Parser unit tests for each new pattern — using the card's **verbatim Oracle text**, never a paraphrase (a paraphrase can take a different parser branch than the real card)
- [ ] Negative tests carry a positive reach-guard: any `!detector(...)` / "does not parse to X" assertion must also prove the input parsed past upstream short-circuits (zero `Effect::Unimplemented`, expected positive shape) — otherwise an early-return makes it pass vacuously
- [ ] Runtime discriminating test when the change claims runtime behavior (see `/card-test`): parser shape tests alone are acceptable ONLY when unsupported semantics remain honestly `Unimplemented`/red in coverage
- [ ] Snapshot tests: `oracle_ir/snapshot_tests.rs` (IR + lowered parity, insta), plus per-module `snapshot_tests.rs` in `oracle_static/`
- [ ] `cargo coverage` — Unimplemented count should decrease
- [ ] Verify per CLAUDE.md § "Canonical verification pattern" — `cargo fmt --all`, then if `tilt get uiresource clippy >/dev/null 2>&1`: `./scripts/tilt-wait.sh --timeout 240 clippy test-engine card-data`; else: `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` + `cargo test -p engine` + `./scripts/gen-card-data.sh`.

### 9b. Adding a New Effect Type

Cross-reference the `/add-engine-effect` skill for the full 8-phase lifecycle (types → handler → targeting → parser → interactive → multiplayer → frontend → AI → tests).

### 9c. Adding a New Trigger Event

Cross-reference the `/add-trigger` skill. Parser-specific: add pattern in `try_parse_event()`, wire subject into `valid_card`/`valid_source`, add tests.

**Simple-verb events** (e.g., `stations`, `crews a vehicle`, `saddles a mount`, `becomes saddled`): add a `SimpleEvent::*` variant in `parse_simple_event`, then a `tag(...)` arm in the appropriate `alt()` group. Compound events (e.g., `saddles a mount or crews a vehicle`) MUST precede their singular components so the compound matches first. Dispatch sets `def.mode` + `valid_card` (or `valid_source` for pronoun-context subjects).

**Actor-side compound-subject matchers**: when a trigger's subject filter may include non-source creatures (e.g., "Tiana or another legendary creature you control crews a Vehicle"), the runtime matcher MUST consult `trigger.valid_card` against the event's actor list (e.g., `event.creatures`) via `matches_target_filter` from `game/filter.rs`. See `match_crews` / `match_saddles` / `match_saddles_or_crews` + the shared `match_actor_against_filter` helper in `trigger_matchers.rs` for the canonical pattern.

**Condition-scoped constraint recognition**: trigger-frequency qualifiers like `"for the first time each turn"` must be detected against the post-`split_trigger` condition text only, NOT the full Oracle text — otherwise any card whose EFFECT text coincidentally contains the phrase is silently constrained. The phrase is then stripped from `condition_text` before dispatch so verbatim handlers (e.g., `"whenever you cycle another card"`) hit unchanged, and the constraint is applied as a fallback in `parse_trigger_line` only when no stronger text-based constraint (`OnlyDuringYourMainPhase`, `OncePerTurn` via explicit text) was set. See the condition-scoped assignment block in `parse_trigger_line` for the canonical pattern.

### 9d. Adding a New Phrase Helper

1. Identify phrase variants
2. Implement via `match_phrase_variants()` in `oracle_util.rs`
3. Export from module
4. Add tests for all variants

### 9e. Adding a New Replacement Pattern

1. Add `parse_*` function matching the Oracle text
2. Insert at correct priority in `parse_replacement_line()` — before any overlapping pattern
3. Add parser tests

---

## 10. Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `starts_with("verb ")` for dispatch | Bypasses nom, no structured errors | `tag("verb ").parse(lower)` or `nom_on_lower` |
| `&text[N..]` hardcoded byte offset | Off-by-one, mixed-case breakage | `nom_on_lower` calculates remainder automatically |
| `find()` / `split_once()` / `contains()` for parsing | Bypasses nom architecture | Use nom combinators — Rule Zero |
| Reimplementing number/color/mana parsing | Duplicates existing combinators | Delegate to `oracle_nom::primitives` |
| `tag("a")` without word boundary | "another" falsely matches as "a" | Use `parse_article_number` |
| `parse_number` for X-cost values | X not converted to 0 | Use `parse_number_or_x` |
| Hardcoding `amount: 1` when unparseable | Gap invisible in coverage | Return `Effect::Unimplemented` |
| Boolean flags on effect types | Undefined combinations, obscured intent | Use enum variant |
| Losing subject via `strip_subject_clause` | "Its controller gains life" → wrong player | Add `try_parse_*` interceptor |
| Pattern too broad, shadows existing | Existing cards break | Specific before general; test existing patterns |
| `parse_target` for possessive forms | No target found → Unimplemented | Use `contains_possessive` → Controller |
| `contains_possessive` for targeting forms | Targeting skipped → wrong player | Use `parse_target` → typed filter |
| Monolithic condition parsing | Fragile, card-specific | Use subject+event decomposition |
| Splitting on " and " naively | Breaks compound effects | Use `try_split_targeted_compound` |
| Putting `Fixed(i32)` inside `QuantityRef` | Wrong abstraction layer | `QuantityRef` = dynamic only; `Fixed` in `QuantityExpr` |
| Editing `mod.rs` when sub-module is right | Bloats orchestrator | Token → `token.rs`, mana → `mana.rs`, counters → `counter.rs`, leading conditions → `conditions.rs` |
| `unwrap()` on parse results | Parser panics on unknown text | Return `None` or `Effect::Unimplemented` |
| Not recognizing `~` as self-reference | Self-targeting fails | `parse_target` handles both `~` and type phrases |
| Inline `use nom::*` in function bodies | CLAUDE.md prohibition | All imports at file top |
| `Unimplemented` with misleading `name` | Coverage miscategorizes gap | Actual verb as `name`, full text as `description` |
| **Peek-vs-chomp** — upstream `scan_*` / detector reads marker text without consuming, downstream loop re-encounters and warns or drops it | "Swallow:*" warning emitted even though semantic was captured upstream; or qualifier text silently dropped on routing | Either single-pass read-and-chomp in the upstream helper, OR add a matching consume-without-record arm in the downstream dispatch loop. See `scan_distinct_names_clause` (peek) ↔ `parse_search_filter_suffixes` "with different name[s]" (chomp) for the canonical pair. |

## 11. Diagnostics — Swallow Detectors & `parse_warnings`

The parser must never silently discard Oracle text. Every clause must either be represented in the parsed AST OR cause the line to fail and yield `Effect::Unimplemented` carrying the original phrase. **Anything in between is a parser lie.**

The `crates/engine/src/parser/swallow_check.rs` module audits each card's parsed `ParsedAbilities` against its original Oracle text and emits a `parse_warning` for every marker phrase that has no AST representation. Findings surface in the coverage report via `CardFace::parse_warnings` (also written into each card's entry in `client/public/card-data.json`).

**Reading current swallow gaps:**

```bash
# Count total active warnings
jq -r '[.[] | .parse_warnings // [] | .[]] | length' client/public/card-data.json

# Top clustered warning patterns by likely shared fix.
cargo run -p engine --bin coverage-report -- data --brief \
  --write-warning-patterns /tmp/parser-warning-patterns.json >/tmp/coverage.json
jq -r '
  [.[] | select(.category=="swallowed-clause")]
  | sort_by(-.otherwise_supported_cards, -.card_count)
  | .[0:25][]
  | "\(.otherwise_supported_cards) otherwise / \(.card_count) cards / \(.single_gap_cards) single | \(.pattern) | \(.example_cards|join(", "))"
' /tmp/parser-warning-patterns.json

# Drill down into one exact warning pattern. This uses the same clustering
# function as parser-warning-patterns.json and includes support status,
# gap count, warning text, parsed labels, and gap details.
cargo run -p engine --bin coverage-report -- data \
  --warning-category swallowed-clause \
  --warning-pattern 'Replacement_Instead: instead' \
  --warning-limit 20 >/tmp/warning-drilldown.json

# Drill down into a broader detector family when exact-pattern slices are too narrow.
cargo run -p engine --bin coverage-report -- data \
  --warning-detector Replacement_Instead \
  --warning-limit 20 >/tmp/warning-drilldown.json

# Include the full parse_details tree and exported CardFace JSON when needed.
cargo run -p engine --bin coverage-report -- data \
  --warning-detector DynamicQty \
  --warning-full \
  --warning-limit 5 >/tmp/warning-drilldown-full.json
```

**Detector class prefixes** (one row per detector in `swallow_check.rs`):

| Prefix | What it flags |
|---|---|
| `Condition_If` | "if <condition>" present in text but no `condition`/`constraint`/`if_clause` slot in AST |
| `Condition_Unless` | "unless …" not bound to `unless_filter` / `unless_*` slot |
| `Condition_AsLongAs` | "as long as …" not bound to a conditional static |
| `DynamicQty` | "for each / equal to / the number of / twice / half" present but AST has only `Fixed` quantity values — the canonical **count parsed but routed downstream as Fixed** bug class |
| `Duration_ThisTurn` / `_UntilEndOfTurn` / `_NextTurn` | duration phrase present but no `duration` slot populated |
| `Optional_YouMay` / `_MayHave` | "you may …" / "may have it …" not bound to the optional flag |
| `Replacement_Instead` | " instead" present but no replacement definition emitted or the detector has a false positive because the AST represented the replacement through another supported structure |
| `ActivateOnlyDuring` / `ActivateLimit` | activation timing/limit phrase not bound to a restriction slot |
| `APNAP` | "starting with you" / "in turn order" not bound to order metadata |
| `target-fallback:` | secondary class — `parse_target` couldn't classify a noun phrase, or a downstream chomping loop encountered an unmatched filter suffix |

Current `card-data.json` stores parse warnings as structured diagnostics, not legacy strings:

```json
{ "type": "SwallowedClause", "detector": "Replacement_Instead", "description": "...", "line_index": 0 }
```

Use `--warning-detector <detector>` for broad-family triage and `--warning-pattern '<detector>: <normalized excerpt>'` for exact shared-fix slices. A high `supported_cards` count in the drilldown means the warning is likely detector noise or an already-parsed semantic that `swallow_check.rs` does not recognize yet; inspect `parsed_labels` before adding parser behavior.

**Workflow:**
1. Start with `parser-warning-patterns.json` sorted by `otherwise_supported_cards`; this finds the largest likely false-positive or minor-chomp groups.
2. Run `coverage-report --warning-pattern ...` or `--warning-detector ...` and inspect `supported`, `gap_count`, `parsed_labels`, and `gap_details` before editing parser code.
3. Classify the pattern: detector false positive, parsed primary effect with missing modifier, or real parser gap.
4. When fixing a real swallow, identify the dispatch site that *recognized* the marker but failed to either capture or chomp it. The fix is almost always at one of two places: the upstream recognition (route through the right `try_parse_*` interceptor) or the downstream chomping loop (add a missing arm). The peek-vs-chomp pitfall in §10 is the recurring root cause.
5. After fixing, regenerate (`./scripts/gen-card-data.sh`) and rerun the same drilldown; warnings should drop by exactly the affected class size unless other detectors were un-muted.
6. **Suppression rule** — suppression is **per source unit**, never card-wide. A unit that owns an `Effect::Unimplemented` has already declared its gap explicitly, so its own expectations are not re-reported as swallowed clauses; every *other* unit on the card is still audited. Fixing one unit's gap can therefore un-mute that unit's own detector warnings, but never another unit's.

**Scope** — the audit runs once per source unit (a distinct span of Oracle text), not once per card. Both halves are unit-scoped: the expectation comes from that unit's own fragment, and the evidence from the definitions that unit produced. `line_index` names the line the clause was swallowed on.

---

## 12. Self-Maintenance

After completing work using this skill:

1. **Verify references** by running `./scripts/check-skill-doc.sh`
2. **Update the priority table** (§3) if slots were added/removed/renamed in `parse_oracle_ir` — the gate compares the table against the `// Priority <label>:` comments
3. **Update the AST family tables** (§4b) if new families or continuations were added
4. **Update the deep dive** (§5) if new sub-modules were added to `oracle_effect/`
5. **Update the module catalog** (§6) if new `oracle_*.rs` modules or `oracle_static/` submodules were added

### Verification Gate — `scripts/check-skill-doc.sh`

The verification script lives at `scripts/check-skill-doc.sh` and **runs in CI**
(rust-lint job, alongside the parser combinator gate), so this document cannot
silently drift from the source tree. It asserts three invariant families:

1. **Paths** — every parser file/directory documented here exists.
2. **Anchor symbols** — the load-bearing functions named in this document
   (`parse_oracle_ir`, `lower_oracle_ir`, `peel_clause`, `parse_inner_condition`,
   the three condition bridges, `strip_trailing_duration`, …) still live in the
   documented files.
3. **Priority table sync** — the §3 table's labeled-row count equals the number
   of `// Priority <label>:` slot comments in `oracle.rs`, and every label that
   appears in code appears in the table. Cosmetic doc edits don't trip it;
   adding, removing, or renaming a slot without updating §3 does.

```bash
./scripts/check-skill-doc.sh   # exit 0 = doc in sync; non-zero lists drift
```

When the gate fails: update the relevant section here (not the script's
expectations) unless the code change itself was wrong. When documenting a new
slot, give it a `| \`label\` |` row in §3; unlabeled interleaved handlers use
`| — |` rows, which the gate ignores.
