# Adding a Frontend Component

> **Hard rules — all frontend work must respect these (see CLAUDE.md § Design Principles):**
> 1. **The frontend is a display layer, not a logic layer.** It renders engine-provided state and dispatches user actions — nothing more. It must never compute, derive, filter, or re-interpret game data. If a component needs a value the engine doesn't expose, the fix is to add it to the engine's output — not to calculate it client-side. Any "smart" frontend code is a bug.
> 2. **CR-correctness is non-negotiable.** The frontend must never contradict the Comprehensive Rules. If it displays information (legal targets, valid choices, game state), that information must come directly from the engine, which is the CR-validated source of truth. Never approximate engine logic in TypeScript.
> 3. **Build reusable component patterns.** New overlays and modals should follow existing patterns (CardChoiceModal, ModeChoiceModal). Extract shared behavior into composable components rather than duplicating across one-off implementations.
> 4. **All frontend-authored text is internationalized.** Every user-facing string the frontend authors (titles, labels, buttons, tooltips, placeholders, log templates, status messages) MUST go through `t()` via `react-i18next` — never a hardcoded literal in JSX. The boundary rule: *a string gets `t()` if and only if the frontend authored it.* Engine/card-database pass-through (card names, Oracle text, interpolated enum strings like phase/mana/counter type) stays **raw** — it is localized by a separate MTGJSON content pipeline, not `t()`. See `client/src/i18n/README.md` (the authority) before adding any string.

The React/TypeScript frontend communicates with the Rust engine through a transport-agnostic adapter layer. Game state flows from engine → adapter → Zustand stores → React components. Player actions flow in reverse via `dispatch()`. This skill covers wiring new UI components into this pipeline.

**Before you start:** Trace how `ScryChoice` works end-to-end. The current path is: `WaitingFor::ScryChoice` in Rust → TypeScript type in `adapter/types.ts` → `GamePage.tsx` renders `CardChoiceModal` → `CardChoiceModal` routes to `ScryModal` → `dispatch({ type: "SelectCards", data: { cards } })`.

## Architecture Overview

```
Engine (Rust/WASM)
    ↓ ActionResult { events, waiting_for }
Adapter (WasmAdapter / WebSocketAdapter / TauriAdapter)
    ↓ GameEvent[], GameState, WaitingFor
Stores (Zustand)
    ├─ gameStore: gameState, waitingFor, legalActions, events, dispatch
    ├─ uiStore: selectedObjectId, targetingMode, combatMode
    └─ animationStore: activeStep, queue, positionRegistry
        ↓
React Components
    ├─ GamePage.tsx — routes WaitingFor → overlays/modals
    ├─ components/modal/ — interactive overlays (CardChoiceModal, ModeChoiceModal, ReplacementModal, NamedChoiceModal)
    ├─ components/board/ — battlefield, permanents, player areas
    ├─ components/hand/ — player/opponent hand
    ├─ components/combat/ — attacker/blocker controls
    ├─ components/animation/ — VFX overlay
    └─ components/log/ — game event log
```

## Key Files

### Type Definitions — `client/src/adapter/types.ts`

**Manually maintained** TypeScript discriminated unions mirroring Rust serde output (`tag="type", content="data"`):

```typescript
// WaitingFor — ~19 variants, determines which overlay to show
type WaitingFor =
  | { type: "Priority"; data: { player: PlayerId } }
  | { type: "ScryChoice"; data: { player: PlayerId; cards: ObjectId[] } }
  | { type: "DigChoice"; data: { player: PlayerId; cards: ObjectId[]; keep_count: number } }
  // ...

// GameAction — ~18 variants, player responses
type GameAction =
  | { type: "SelectCards"; data: { cards: ObjectId[] } }
  | { type: "ChooseReplacement"; data: { index: number } }
  // ...

// GameEvent — ~33 variants, for log + animations
type GameEvent =
  | { type: "DamageDealt"; data: { source_id: ObjectId; target: TargetRef; amount: number } }
  // ...
```

### Game Store — `client/src/stores/gameStore.ts`

```typescript
interface GameStoreState {
  gameState: GameState | null;
  waitingFor: WaitingFor | null;
  legalActions: GameAction[];
  events: GameEvent[];         // Latest batch
  eventHistory: GameEvent[];   // Rolling window (last 1000)
  adapter: EngineAdapter | null;
}
```

Key action: `dispatch(action: GameAction)` → adapter.submitAction → animations → state update.

### UI Store — `client/src/stores/uiStore.ts`

Ephemeral UI state — targeting mode, combat selections, hovered/selected objects. Combat selections stay in `uiStore` until the player confirms (optimistic UI pattern).

### Dispatch Pipeline — `client/src/game/dispatch.ts`

```
User action
  → Capture DOM snapshot (pre-animation positions)
  → adapter.submitAction(action)
  → normalizeEvents(events) → AnimationSteps
  → enqueueSteps (animation store)
  → Wait for animation duration
  → Update gameStore (state, waitingFor, legalActions)
  → Save to localStorage
```

### WaitingFor → UI Routing — `client/src/pages/GamePage.tsx`

Conditional rendering based on `waitingFor.type` + `playerId` check:

```tsx
{(waitingFor?.type === "TargetSelection" ||
  waitingFor?.type === "TriggerTargetSelection") &&
  waitingFor.data.player === playerId && <TargetingOverlay />}
<ModeChoiceModal />
<CardChoiceModal />
{waitingFor?.type === "ReplacementChoice" &&
  waitingFor.data.player === playerId && <ReplacementModal />}
```

**All overlays gate on `waitingFor.data.player === playerId`** to prevent the wrong player from seeing choices in multiplayer.

## Checklist — Adding a New Frontend Component

### Phase 1 — TypeScript Types

- [ ] **`client/src/adapter/types.ts` — `WaitingFor` union** (if new interactive state)
  Add a variant matching the Rust `WaitingFor` enum. Must match the serde output format exactly:
  ```typescript
  | { type: "YourChoice"; data: { player: PlayerId; cards: ObjectId[]; /* ... */ } }
  ```
  The `player` field is required — it gates UI visibility.

- [ ] **`client/src/adapter/types.ts` — `GameAction` union** (if new response type)
  Add the response variant. Reuse `SelectCards` if the response is just card IDs.
  ```typescript
  | { type: "YourResponse"; data: { selection: /* ... */ } }
  ```

- [ ] **`client/src/adapter/types.ts` — `GameEvent` union** (if new event for log/animation)
  ```typescript
  | { type: "YourEvent"; data: { /* event payload */ } }
  ```

- [ ] **`client/src/adapter/types.ts` — `GameObject` interface** (if new fields on objects)
  Add optional fields with `?:` to avoid breaking existing state deserialization.

### Phase 2 — Component Implementation

Three common patterns for new components:

#### Pattern A: Card Choice Overlay (most interactive effects)

Used by: Scry, Dig, Surveil, Reveal, Search, DiscardToHandSize.

```tsx
// client/src/components/modal/YourOverlay.tsx
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

import { useGameStore } from "../../stores/gameStore";
import { useUiStore } from "../../stores/uiStore";
import { useGameDispatch } from "../../hooks/useGameDispatch";

export function YourOverlay({ data }: { data: YourChoiceData }) {
  const { t } = useTranslation("game"); // namespace = source directory, not subject
  const objects = useGameStore((s) => s.gameState?.objects ?? {});
  const inspectObject = useUiStore((s) => s.inspectObject);
  const dispatch = useGameDispatch();
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

  const handleConfirm = () => {
    dispatch({ type: "SelectCards", data: { cards: [...selected] } });
  };

  return (
    <AnimatePresence>
      <motion.div
        initial={{ opacity: 0 }} animate={{ opacity: 1 }} exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
        className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center bg-black/60"
      >
        {/* Card display + selection UI */}
        <button onClick={handleConfirm} disabled={!isValid}>
          {t("yourOverlay.confirm")}
        </button>
      </motion.div>
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
}
```

**Key conventions:**
- `useGameStore` for game state (objects, zones)
- `useUiStore.inspectObject` for card preview on hover
- `useGameDispatch()` to send actions
- Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` for entry/exit animations
- Dark theme: `bg-gray-900`, `ring-1 ring-gray-700`, accent colors (cyan, amber, emerald)
- `fixed inset-0 z-50` for full-screen overlay backdrop

#### Pattern B: Simple Choice Modal

Used by: Mulligan, Play/Draw, modal spells.

```tsx
<ChoiceModal
  title="Choose an option"
  options={[
    { id: "opt1", label: "Option A", description: "Does X" },
    { id: "opt2", label: "Option B", description: "Does Y" },
  ]}
  onChoose={(id) => dispatch({ type: "YourResponse", data: { choice: id } })}
/>
```

#### Pattern C: Board Element

For non-overlay components (new zone display, counter indicators, status badges):
- Place in the relevant subdirectory (`components/board/`, `components/zone/`, etc.)
- Subscribe to `useGameStore` for data
- No dispatch needed if read-only

### Phase 2.5 — Internationalize User-Facing Text

Every string the component authors must be a translation key, not a literal. Do this **as you write the component**, not as a cleanup pass.

- [ ] **Pick the namespace by source directory.** A component's namespace is where it lives, not what it's about: `components/draft/*` → `"draft"`, `components/lobby/*` → `"multiplayer"`, in-game overlays (`components/modal/`, `board/`, `combat/`, etc.) → `"game"`. `common` is the implicit default ns (shared buttons like Cancel/Confirm may already live there — reuse before adding).
  ```tsx
  const { t } = useTranslation("game"); // opt into a ns; common is always available
  ```
- [ ] **Add the key to `client/src/i18n/locales/en/<ns>.json` first.** English is the typing oracle — referencing a key that doesn't exist in `en/` fails type-check. Other locales fall back to English automatically; you do **not** edit `es/fr/de/it/pt` (machine-translated separately).
  - Key shape: nested dot paths, `camelCase` leaves, `<componentOrFeature>.<element>` (e.g. `"yourOverlay.confirm"`, `"yourOverlay.title"`).
- [ ] **Plurals via CLDR, not string math.** Use `key_one` / `key_other` + `t(key, { count })`. Never `count === 1 ? "item" : "items"`.
- [ ] **Interpolate engine data raw into a translated template.** The template is chrome (translate it); the values are engine data (leave raw): `t("yourOverlay.summary", { counterType, count })`.
- [ ] **Leave engine/card pass-through untouched.** Card names, Oracle/reminder text, and enum strings (phase, mana type, counter type) are **not** wrapped — they are localized by the content pipeline (`hooks/useEngineCardData.ts`), not `t()`. When in doubt, apply the boundary rule: did the frontend author this sentence, or is it engine data flowing through?
- [ ] **Never call `i18n.changeLanguage` directly.** The preferences store owns the active language: `usePreferencesStore.getState().setLanguage(lng)`.

See `client/src/i18n/README.md` for the full convention set.

### Phase 3 — GamePage Routing

- [ ] **`client/src/pages/GamePage.tsx` — conditional render**
  Add your overlay to the `GamePageContent` component alongside existing overlays:
  ```tsx
  {waitingFor?.type === "YourChoice" && waitingFor.data.player === playerId && (
    <YourOverlay data={waitingFor.data} />
  )}
  ```
If your overlay is a card choice type, integrate into the existing `CardChoiceModal` switch instead of adding a new top-level conditional.

### Phase 4 — Animation Integration (if applicable)

- [ ] **`client/src/animation/eventNormalizer.ts`** — Event grouping
  If your new `GameEvent` should trigger visual effects:
  - Add to `OWN_STEP_TYPES` if it should always start a new animation step
  - Add to `MERGE_TYPES` if it should merge into the preceding step
  - Add duration to `EVENT_DURATIONS` in `animation/types.ts`

- [ ] **`client/src/components/animation/AnimationOverlay.tsx`** — Visual effect
  Add rendering for your event type if it needs VFX (particles, arcs, screen effects).

### Phase 5 — Game Log (if applicable)

- [ ] **`client/src/viewmodel/logFormatting.ts`** — Event formatting
  Add a case for your `GameEvent` type to produce a human-readable log string. **Translate the template, interpolate engine data raw** — `t("log.yourEvent", { objectId, amount })` where the sentence is chrome and the IDs/amounts are engine data. The log type label is frontend-authored (translate it); the card/object it refers to is not.

- [ ] **`client/src/components/log/LogEntry.tsx`** — Custom rendering (if needed)
  Most events use the default text format. Only add custom rendering for events that need icons, card references, or special formatting.

### Phase 6 — Multiplayer Considerations

- [ ] **Player gating** — Every interactive overlay MUST check `waitingFor.data.player === playerId`. Without this, both players see the choice UI.

- [ ] **State filtering** — If the component displays hidden information (opponent's hand, library cards), ensure the server-side filter in `crates/server-core/src/filter.rs` correctly hides/reveals cards. The frontend should display whatever the filtered state contains — don't add client-side visibility logic.

## Styling Conventions

- **Tailwind CSS v4** — utility classes, no CSS modules
- **Dark theme**: `bg-gray-900` base, `bg-gray-800` cards, `ring-1 ring-gray-700` borders
- **Accent colors**: Cyan (`text-cyan-400`) for info, Amber (`text-amber-400`) for warnings, Emerald (`text-emerald-400`) for success, Red (`text-red-400`) for danger
- **Card sizing**: CSS custom properties `--card-w`, `--card-h` (set by preferences store)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for all transitions. `AnimatePresence` for mount/unmount. Staggered delays: `delay: 0.1 + index * 0.08`
- **Responsive**: `max-w-md` / `max-w-sm` for modals, `inset-0` for full-screen backdrops

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Missing player gate (`waitingFor.data.player === playerId`) | Both players see the overlay in multiplayer | Always check player ID |
| Types don't match Rust serde output | Deserialization silently fails, `waitingFor` is null | Match exact `tag="type", content="data"` format |
| Dispatching action without waiting for animation | State updates before animation completes, visual glitch | Use `useGameDispatch()` which handles the pipeline |
| Adding client-side visibility logic | Diverges from server-filtered state, multiplayer security hole | Trust the filtered state from the adapter |
| Modifying `gameStore` directly | Bypasses animation pipeline and persistence | Always go through `dispatch()` |
| Not using `AnimatePresence` | Overlay appears/disappears instantly | Wrap in `AnimatePresence` with enter/exit transitions |
| Hardcoded user-facing string in JSX | Untranslatable; breaks 6-locale support | Route frontend-authored text through `t()` (Phase 2.5) |
| Wrapping card/Oracle/enum text in `t()` | Double-localizes engine data; key never resolves | Leave engine pass-through raw; only `t()` frontend-authored text |
| Hand-rolled `count === 1 ? "x" : "xs"` pluralization | Wrong for non-English CLDR rules | `key_one`/`key_other` + `t(key, { count })` |
