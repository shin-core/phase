"""Full-tree census of raw zone mutation in the engine.

Every gameplay zone change must go through the replacement-consulting pipeline
(`zone_pipeline::move_object` -> `ApprovedZoneChange` -> delivery). Code that
calls the raw movers in `game/zones.rs`, pokes the `im::Vector` zone containers
directly, or assigns `GameObject::zone` bypasses replacement consultation,
`ZoneChanged` events, triggers, and draw bookkeeping.

This census is the hard authority gate for that migration (Plan 03). It
classifies every production hit by (file, enclosing fn, pattern family), and
fails every hit that lacks a nonempty `allow-raw-zone:` annotation. An
annotation records a reviewed operation that is not a replaceable zone event;
it remains visible in `--list` rather than disappearing from the census.

Pattern families (a hit is classified into exactly one):

    mover        the five raw movers game/zones.rs exports
    container    direct membership mutation of an im::Vector zone container
    zone-assign  direct `GameObject::zone = ...`
    borrow       a `&mut <expr>.<zone>` handed to a callee that is not known to
                 preserve membership (a shuffle is; anything else must prove it)
    exempt       any of the above, annotated `// allow-raw-zone: <reason>`

The annotation reason is mandatory. A raw zone operation cannot be introduced
without naming why it is outside the replacement-consulting pipeline.

Usage:
    scripts/zone_authority_census.py --check      # gate (used by CI)
    scripts/zone_authority_census.py --list       # report every classified hit

# emits its tick as ordinary code. (The byte form `b'x'` needs no prefix alternative:
