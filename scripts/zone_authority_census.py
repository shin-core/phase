"""Full-tree census of raw zone mutation in the engine.

Every gameplay zone change must go through the replacement-consulting pipeline
(`zone_pipeline::move_object` -> `ApprovedZoneChange` -> delivery). Code that
calls the raw movers in `game/zones.rs`, pokes the `im::Vector` zone containers
directly, or assigns `GameObject::zone` bypasses replacement consultation,
`ZoneChanged` events, triggers, and draw bookkeeping.

This census is the ratchet for that migration (Plan 03). It classifies every
production hit by (file, enclosing fn, pattern family) and compares the result
against `scripts/zone-authority-baseline.txt`:

  * a hit that is NOT in the baseline fails    -> new bypass, route it properly
  * a baseline row whose count DROPPED fails   -> stale baseline, tighten it

so the allowlist can only shrink. When the baseline reaches zero rows the
migration is complete and the gate is zero-tolerance by construction.

Pattern families (a hit is classified into exactly one):

    mover        the five raw movers game/zones.rs exports
    container    direct membership mutation of an im::Vector zone container
    zone-assign  direct `GameObject::zone = ...`
    borrow       a `&mut <expr>.<zone>` handed to a callee that is not known to
                 preserve membership (a shuffle is; anything else must prove it)
    exempt       any of the above, annotated `// allow-raw-zone: <reason>`

`exempt` is ratcheted like the rest, deliberately. The annotation is the
cheapest possible way to add a raw zone mutation, so it must cost a review
rather than a keystroke -- an exemption no instrument counts is an exemption
nobody revisits. The reason string is mandatory.

Usage:
    scripts/zone_authority_census.py --check      # gate (used by CI)
    scripts/zone_authority_census.py --list       # report every classified hit
    scripts/zone_authority_census.py --write      # regenerate the baseline

# The char alternative is EXACTLY ONE char (or one escape) followed by the closing

# emits its tick as ordinary code. (The byte form `b'x'` needs no prefix alternative:

#
# Over-inclusion here is free (the branch logic below rejects a false candidate

# these characters.
#
# EVERY alternative starts with a character from one small set, deliberately:
# that lets the regex engine prefilter on the first character and skip runs of

# boundary -- it defeats the prefilter and drags the scan back to per-character
# lookaround. `_at_token_boundary` already enforces it, in Python, at the few
# positions that survive this far.
# The `r?` in the lookahead is load-bearing: it lets the candidate fire on the
# FIRST letter of a two-letter prefix (`br#"`, `cr"`). Without it the scan stops
# on the `r` instead, where the boundary check correctly rejects it -- and the

# This is MIGRATION DEBT, and it is a ratchet: rows may only shrink. Each row
# is a site that still mutates a zone without going through zone_pipeline. As
# the Plan 03 tranches migrate them onto ZoneMoveRequest, delete the rows
# (scripts/zone_authority_census.py --write). When this file is empty the gate
# is zero-tolerance by construction.
#
# A site that is genuinely NOT a replaceable zone event (CR 733 rollback,
# component absorption, in-library reorder, cease-to-exist, test setup) does
# not belong here -- it is a permanent, named exemption and is annotated at the
# call site instead:
#
#     // allow-raw-zone: <one-line reason>
