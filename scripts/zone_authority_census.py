"""Full-tree census of raw zone mutation in the engine.

Every gameplay zone change must go through the replacement-consulting pipeline
(`zone_pipeline::move_object` -> `ApprovedZoneChange` -> delivery). Code that
calls the raw movers in `game/zones.rs`, pokes the `im::Vector` zone containers
directly, or assigns `GameObject::zone` bypasses replacement consultation,
`ZoneChanged` events, triggers, and draw bookkeeping.

This census is the ratchet for that migration (Plan 03). It classifies every
production hit by (file, enclosing fn, pattern family) and compares the result
against `scripts/zone-authority-baseline.txt`:

  * a hit that is NOT in the baseline fails    -> new bypass, route it properly
  * a baseline row whose count DROPPED fails   -> stale baseline, tighten it

so the allowlist can only shrink. When the baseline reaches zero rows the
migration is complete and the gate is zero-tolerance by construction.

Pattern families (a hit is classified into exactly one):

    mover        the five raw movers game/zones.rs exports
    container    direct membership mutation of an im::Vector zone container
    zone-assign  direct `GameObject::zone = ...`
    borrow       a `&mut <expr>.<zone>` handed to a callee that is not known to
                 preserve membership (a shuffle is; anything else must prove it)
    exempt       any of the above, annotated `// allow-raw-zone: <reason>`

`exempt` is ratcheted like the rest, deliberately. The annotation is the
cheapest possible way to add a raw zone mutation, so it must cost a review
rather than a keystroke -- an exemption no instrument counts is an exemption
nobody revisits. The reason string is mandatory.

Usage:
    scripts/zone_authority_census.py --check      # gate (used by CI)
    scripts/zone_authority_census.py --list       # report every classified hit
    scripts/zone_authority_census.py --write      # regenerate the baseline
