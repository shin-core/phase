# Wait for one or more Tilt resources to reach a terminal state for the CURRENT code.
#
# Usage: tilt-wait.sh [--interval SECONDS] [--timeout SECONDS] <resource>...
#
# Exit codes:
#   0    all resources are fresh and reached updateStatus=ok with no in-flight build
#   1    a resource is fresh and reached updateStatus=error with no in-flight build
#   2    usage error
#   3    cannot answer the question (Tilt not reachable, or Tilt watches a different
#        checkout than this one). NOT a build failure -- never report it as one.
#   124  --timeout elapsed before all resources settled
#
# 1 vs 3 is load-bearing: 1 means "your code is broken", 3 means "I could not find out".
# Collapsing them is how a wrong-checkout or a stopped Tilt gets misread as a compile error,
# which teaches callers to distrust the script -- and a distrusted freshness gate gets
# bypassed, which restores the very false green this script exists to prevent.
#
# A resource must be both TERMINAL and FRESH before its status is believed.
#
#   Terminal: currentBuild.spanID == "none". This avoids reacting to a stale
#   buildHistory error while a newer build is still compiling.
#
#   Fresh: the last build STARTED after the newest change to the files that resource is
#   built from. A build status is only ever a statement about the code that build
#   actually compiled. If the last build started before your edit, its "ok" describes
#   the code as it was BEFORE the change -- a green that measured nothing. A stale
#   resource is simply not terminal yet: we keep waiting for the rebuild (and report the
#   usual 124 if it never arrives), so the exit-code contract above is unchanged. The
#   same applies to a stale "error": it is not reported, because it describes old code.
#
# The freshness reference is derived per resource from Tilt's own watch config, so
# callers pass nothing extra (`tilt get filewatch local:<resource> -o json`):
#
#   .spec.watchedPaths         roots this resource rebuilds from (clippy: crates/,
#                              check-frontend: client/src/, card-data: crates/engine/src/)
#   .spec.ignores              paths/patterns Tilt does not rebuild for
#   .status.fileEvents[].time  changes Tilt has already observed
#
# A resource is stale when Tilt has observed a change since its last build started (a
# rebuild is coming), or when a file under its watchedPaths is newer than that build's
# startTime (the edit landed on disk but Tilt's watcher has not caught up -- the window
# that produced false greens). Scoping the reference per resource is what keeps this from
# over-waiting: a Rust-only edit does not make `check-frontend` stale, because
# check-frontend is not built from crates/.
#
# Known limits, kept loud rather than silent:
#   * A resource with no watchedPaths (the manual `coverage`) has no freshness reference.
#     It warns on stderr and falls back to status-only.
#   * Tilt watches one checkout. Running this from a different worktree than the one Tilt
#     watches is a hard error (exit 1): no build over there can describe your edits here.
