# Diff-based gate: new engine code must go through the single-authority
# helpers instead of poking at raw state the authority encapsulates.
#
# Existing offenders are frozen in amber — this check only flags *newly
# added* offending lines in the diff (same mechanism as
# check-parser-combinators.sh).
#
# Pattern families:
#   (A) Raw keyword queries: `.keywords.contains(` / `.keywords.iter(`.
#       Battlefield objects' post-layer `obj.keywords` happens to be correct,
#       but the same query against a hand/graveyard/exile object silently
#       misses off-zone grants. The authorities in game/keywords.rs make the
#       choice explicit:
#           keywords::has_keyword / has_keyword_kind            (object-scoped)
#           keywords::object_has_effective_keyword_kind          (state-scoped,
#               consults off_zone_characteristics — required for anything that
#               can run on a non-battlefield object)
#
#   (B) Raw zone mutation: the movers in game/zones.rs, direct writes to the
#       zone containers, and direct `GameObject::zone` assignment. Any of these
#       skips replacement consultation, `ZoneChanged`, triggers, and draw
#       bookkeeping. Gameplay zone changes go through zone_pipeline.
#       Unlike (A), this section is FULL-TREE, not diff-only: it is a ratchet
#       against a frozen baseline, so a pre-existing site cannot be quietly
#       duplicated into a new one. See scripts/zone_authority_census.py.
#
# Exempt: lines (or the line immediately above) with
#     // allow-raw-authority: <reason>      (A)
#     // allow-raw-zone: <reason>           (B)
# Allowed files (the authorities themselves and the layer/copy machinery that
# must read raw keyword state): see ALLOWED_KEYWORD_FILES below.

ERROR: New engine code bypasses a single-authority helper.

(A) Raw keyword query — use the authorities in game/keywords.rs:
    obj.keywords.contains(&kw)        ->  keywords::has_keyword(obj, &kw)
    obj.keywords.iter().any(...)      ->  keywords::has_keyword_kind(obj, kind)
    (anything that can run on a non-battlefield object)
                                      ->  keywords::object_has_effective_keyword_kind(state, id, kind)
Raw queries silently miss off-zone keyword grants for hand/graveyard/exile
objects — the state-scoped authority is the only variant that consults
off_zone_characteristics.

Forbidden in added lines (diff vs ${BASE}):
${report_keyword}

If a use is genuinely structural (layer engine internals, characteristic
snapshots), annotate the line with:
