/**
 * Multi-worker AI pool for root parallelism.

 * Each worker owns an independent WASM instance. For VeryHard difficulty,

 * Results are merged by averaging scores per unique action, then the
 * engine worker performs softmax selection in Rust.

 * Research backing: root parallelism has minimal communication overhead
 * (merge only at the end), scales near-linearly up to ~4 workers, and is
 * a natural fit for isolated Web Workers with no shared memory.
