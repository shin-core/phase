/**
 * Vite fires `vite:preloadError` when a lazy-imported chunk fails to load —
 * the canonical "user had a tab open across a deploy and the hashed chunk
 * filename changed" case. The service-worker updater handles the *worker*
 * half of post-deploy recovery (new SW activates → reload); this handles
 * the *chunk* half (running JS tries to import a chunk that no longer
 * exists on the server / in the precache → import rejects).
 *
 * Without this listener the user sees a partially-broken UI and must
 * hard-refresh manually. With it, the app self-recovers.
 *
 * Multiplayer safety: a chunk-load failure mid-lobby or mid-game would
 * still reload and drop the P2P/WebSocket connection. We mirror the
 * service-worker updater's deferral by parking the reload until
 * `whenMultiplayerGameEnds()` fires, so the running game isn't killed for
 * everyone else in it. The user lives with a degraded UI for the rest of
 * the game (one missing lazy route), but the game itself stays alive and
 * the reconnect-on-end story remains intact.
 *
 * Loop breaker: when the failure *persists* (bad cached edge variant,
 * broken client cache), reloading forever turns one broken client into a
 * telemetry storm — observed 2026-07-18 as ~6,500 events/hour from a
 * handful of clients. Reloads are counted per failing chunk in
 * `sessionStorage` (survives reload in the same tab; keys self-reset when
 * chunk hashes change on the next deploy). Only *executed* reloads count —
 * queuing a deferred multiplayer reload does not — so repeated failures
 * during one game can never trip the breaker. After
 * {@link RELOAD_GUARD_MAX} reloads inside {@link RELOAD_GUARD_WINDOW_MS},
 * the handler stops reloading, surfaces the failure via `setUpdateError`,
 * and reports what the failing URL actually returns (status +
 * `cf-cache-status` + `cf-ray` + SW-controlled bit) so a stuck client
 * diagnoses itself in telemetry.
