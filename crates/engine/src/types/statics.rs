/// # How it avoids infinite recursion
/// For both string and object values, the function delegates to
/// `serde_json::from_value::<StaticMode>`, which invokes the **derived**
/// `StaticMode::Deserialize` impl — not this field-level helper. For unknown
/// unit variants (string values that the derived impl rejects), the fallback
/// wraps the raw string in `Other(s)`. No cycle is possible.
///
/// # Why not `FromStr`?
/// `FromStr` for `StaticMode` does not enumerate every unit variant by its
/// exact Rust identifier (it's a separate parser for human-facing strings).
/// Using `FromStr` would map known variants like `"SpendManaAsAnyColor"` to
/// `Other("SpendManaAsAnyColor")` whenever they aren't explicitly listed,
