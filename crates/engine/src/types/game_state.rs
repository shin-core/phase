/// the observation that the dropped payload is byte-identical to the resident one;
/// payload equality was then read as evidence of a dedup. It is not.
///

/// collision-drops**, owned by
/// `wolverine_noncombat_separate_instance_heals_prior_damage` and
/// `flip_coins_three_with_krark_prompts_three_times`. Three facts about them:
///
///   * **They are SIBLING events, not one event twice.** Wolverine's two stashes come
///     from two distinct `Damage` events (two blockers, CR 510.2 simultaneity);
///     Krark's from two distinct `CoinFlip` events. Each event applies the definition
///     exactly once, which is what CR 614.5 licenses — it grants one opportunity *per
///     event*, and there are two events. The applied-set dedup is fully wired
///     (`already_applied` gates candidate selection) and correctly declines to
///     suppress here. Nothing is missing from this path.
///   * **The dropped continuation never runs — in either regime.** Dispatch counts are
///     identical with the drop and with the stack forced to nest: Wolverine dispatches
///     its continuation **zero** times ever (its heal is delivered by
///     `dealt_damage_applier`, never by this stack); Krark dispatches **once**, drop or
///     push. So the drop de-duplicates nothing. Forcing a naive nest leaves the whole
///     engine suite green (16220 passing) — the only casualty is the unit test that
///     tautologically asserts the drop.
///   * **Neither cited rule governs them.** CR 614.5 is per-event; CR 616.1g is about an
///     event *contained within* another. Sibling events fall through both.
///
/// So the drop is not a dedup and not a rules gate. It is a **leak-guard**: it keeps
/// an un-dispatchable sibling-event stash from accumulating on the stack, where a
/// resident `Ready` drain would make `has_ready()` true forever and permanently gate
/// `draw_through_replacement`.
///
