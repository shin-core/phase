//! Cross-item document relations.
//!
//! CR 607.2d: "If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to
//! 'choose a [value]' and an ability printed on it that refers to 'the chosen
//! [value]' … those abilities are linked." A document relation is a link between
//! two (or more) parsed items that a single item cannot express on its own — one
//! item *produces* a fact (a chosen value, an exiled card, a coerced attacker)
//! that another item *consumes*.
//!
//! These links are **text-level anaphoric facts**, recognizable the moment items
//! are emitted with stable ids — not intrinsically properties of the lowered
//! runtime shapes. So they are recovered at parse time by pairing producer and
//! consumer items **by `OracleItemId`** and stored on the `OracleDocIr`, then
//! applied at the single `lower_oracle_ir` seam by resolving those ids back to
//! their lowered definitions. This replaces the former dual authority — scanning
//! the lowered category vectors by shape to *rediscover* the pairs — which the
//! parser/lower split exists to remove.
//!
//! The enum is **closed** (no wildcard): a new document relation must be a named
//! variant, and a new *linked-choice* shape must be a new `LinkedChoiceKind`
//! value, never a new relation variant (CR 607.2d is one rule section, so the
//! whole choice axis is one parameterized variant).
