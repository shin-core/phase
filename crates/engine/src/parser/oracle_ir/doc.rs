//! Document-level Oracle IR types.
//!
//! `OracleDocIr` represents the complete parsed output of a card's Oracle text
//! as a list of `OracleItemIr`. Each item carries a stable `OracleItemId`, an
//! `OracleUnitSource` (byte + line span), and a typed `OracleNodeIr` payload.
//!
//! Items are produced through `OracleDocBuilder`, which is the single authority
//! for item identity, ordering, and span invariants. Nothing constructs an
//! `OracleItemIr` directly.
//!
//! **Unit-3a status.** The builder orders items by `(first_line, ordinal)` and is
//! ready to receive exact spans, but its only current producer is
//! `parsed_abilities_to_doc_ir`, which runs after lowering and can supply only a
//! whole-document containing span (see `OracleSourceSpan::whole_document`). So
//! today's item order still reproduces the category order of `ParsedAbilities`.
//! Unit 3b moves emission into the dispatch loop, at which point items become
//! genuinely source-ordered with exact spans and this note is deleted.

// NOTE ON `dead_code`: suppression in this module is **per item**, never
// module-wide. A module-wide `#![allow(dead_code)]` also silences code not yet
// written, and it is precisely what hid two silent defects here during review
// (an `emit` counter that skipped every `PreLowered*` payload, and a
// `validate_child_span` that failed open). Each suppression below names the unit
// that gives the item a production caller, and dies when that unit lands.
