//! Non-mutating action preview (issue #5468).
//!
//! Diffs the PUBLIC deltas an action would produce — life-total changes and
//! public-zone object transitions — so an embedder can drive hover-preview UX
//! ("this kills that", "you take 4") without committing the action. The caller
//! runs the action on a throwaway clone (never rendered) and passes the
//! before/after snapshots here.
//!
//! Hidden-information safety is guaranteed two ways: callers pass
//! `filter_state_for_viewer` outputs (hands/libraries/face-down identities
//! already redacted, including in `ZoneChange.name`), AND a transition is
//! surfaced only when at least one endpoint is a public zone — so a
//! fully-hidden hand↔library move (a draw) is never surfaced. CR 400.2 draws
//! the public/hidden zone line.
