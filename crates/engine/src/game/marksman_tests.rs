//! Runtime + parser tests for the repeated-optional-payment + reflexive-modal
//! driver (Hawkeye, Master Marksman — "Trick Arrows"). CR 603.12a / CR 700.2d.
//!
//! These drive the real production seams:
//! - the parser (`parse_oracle_text`) for the modal AST (B4);
//! - the production trigger-resolution function (`resolve_ability_chain` at
//!   depth 0, exactly as the engine resolves a stack trigger) to reach the
//!   per-iteration `WaitingFor::OptionalEffectChoice`;
//! - the real action handler (`apply`) for every `DecideOptionalEffect` and
//!   `SelectModes`, so the changed `WaitingFor`/`GameAction` route is exercised.
