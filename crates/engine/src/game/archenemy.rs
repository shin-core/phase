//! CR 904: Archenemy — the scheme deck, setting schemes in motion, and the
//! abandon state-based action.
//!
//! Schemes (CR 314) are nontraditional cards that remain in the command zone
//! throughout the game (CR 314.2), both while face down in the scheme deck and
//! while face up after being set in motion. They are not permanents and can't
//! be cast (CR 314.2).
//!
//! In the single-scheme-deck Archenemy option (CR 904.3 / CR 904.4) the engine
//! tracks one deck in [`GameState::scheme_deck`] (front = top, face down).
//! Schemes that are set in motion (CR 904.9) turn face up and live in
//! [`GameState::command_zone`]; non-ongoing schemes are turned face down and put
//! on the bottom of the scheme deck by a state-based action (CR 904.10 /
//! CR 314.6), while ongoing schemes (CR 904.11) stay face up until an ability
//! abandons them.
//!
//! This is the runtime sibling of `game::planechase`: it owns setting a scheme
//! in motion ([`set_in_motion`]), abandoning a scheme ([`abandon`]), and the
//! non-ongoing-scheme state-based action ([`check_scheme_abandon_sba`]).
//!
//! Trigger collection: scheme triggers function from the command zone because
//! `synthesize_archenemy` stamps `trigger_zones = [Zone::Command]` onto them
//! (CR 113.6b / CR 314.4 / CR 904.8). The set-in-motion and abandon
//! turn-based/state-based actions don't use the stack (CR 904.9 / CR 904.10),
//! but the resulting triggered abilities are collected the next time a player
//! would receive priority (CR 603.2 / CR 603.3). The two actions collect their
//! triggers via DIFFERENT mechanisms, and this asymmetry is deliberate:
//!
//! - [`set_in_motion`] does NOT self-collect. Every real path to it runs through
//!   `finish_enter_phase` during a `pass_priority_once_with_pipeline`, which is
//!   immediately followed by `run_post_action_pipeline`'s normal post-action
//!   event scan; that scan collects the `SchemeSetInMotion` trigger exactly once
//!   (it may place it directly on the stack rather than deferring — rules-
//!   equivalent under CR 603.2 / CR 603.3).
//! - [`abandon`] DOES self-collect (single authority), because an abandon effect
//!   turns a face-up ongoing scheme face down and removes it from the command
//!   zone. It collects the `SchemeAbandoned` trigger while the scheme is still
//!   face up in the command zone (CR 314.4 / CR 904.8), THEN turns it face down
//!   and removes it from the command zone, so the normal post-action / SBA-loop
//!   trigger scan — which only inspects objects currently in the command zone —
//!   never sees the departed scheme and cannot double-collect. No special
//!   pipeline handling is needed: this is the same leave-the-command-zone
//!   self-collect pattern `planechase::planeswalk` uses.
//!
//! The two-scheme-deck Supervillain Rumble option (CR 904.12) is deferred: this
//! module models the single-archenemy game (CR 904.2a).
