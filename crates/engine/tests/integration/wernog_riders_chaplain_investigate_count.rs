//! Integration tests for Wernog, Rider's Chaplain's "you investigate X times,
//! where X is one plus the number of opponents who investigated this way"
//! clause (CR 608.2c + CR 109.5 + CR 701.16a).
//!
//! The third sub-ability already parses with
//! `repeat_for: Variable("one plus the number of opponents who investigated
//! this way")` because the inner player-action count did not resolve. Once the
//! "[population] who investigated this way" combinator and the
//! `PlayerActionKind::Investigate` ledger event are in place, the inner count
//! resolves to `PlayerCount { PerformedActionThisWay { Opponent, Investigate } }`
//! and the wrapping "one plus" produces `Offset(+1, …)`.
//!
//! This mirrors `tempt_with_discovery.rs` — the identical "each opponent may X,
//! then you do X once per opponent who did" machinery, but for Investigate
//! instead of SearchLibrary.
//!
//! Clause 2 ("each opponent who doesn't loses 1 life") is now decline-gated to
//! clause 1's optional investigate (CR 118.12 + CR 608.2d + CR 109.5): only an
//! opponent who DECLINES the optional investigate loses 1 life. The
//! subject-only OPTIONAL-decline path (`strip_each_scope_who_doesnt_subject` in
//! `parser/oracle_effect/mod.rs`) lowers it as a `Not{effect_performed()}`-gated
//! `ContinuationStep` sub-ability rather than the previous unconditional
//! `SequentialSibling`. See `wernog_clause2_only_declining_opponent_loses_life`
//! below for the discriminating runtime proof.
