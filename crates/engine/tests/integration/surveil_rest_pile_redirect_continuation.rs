//! Phase C6 (zone-change pipeline) discriminating tests for the rest-pile
//! batch migration: the surveil graveyard "rest pile" now routes through
//! `zone_pipeline::move_objects_simultaneously_then`, so each unkept card's own
//! `Moved` redirects fire (Rest in Peace / Leyline of the Void: "would be put
//! into a graveyard from anywhere → exile instead"), and the post-loop
//! kept-on-top library reorder runs exactly once on batch completion — including
//! when a per-card CR 616.1 ordering choice pauses the pile mid-delivery.
//!
//! Before C6 the handler delivered every unkept card with a bare
//! `zones::move_to_zone(.., Zone::Graveyard, ..)`, which proposed no per-card
//! ZoneChange and silently skipped the redirects; the kept-on-top reorder ran
//! inline at the end of the loop, so a mid-pile pause (two simultaneous
//! redirects) could not be supported at all (that is why C6 was deferred twice).
//!
//! Two tests:
//!  1. `surveil_rest_pile_honors_graveyard_exile_redirect` — single redirect: the
//!     unkept cards land in EXILE, the kept card stays on top of the library, and
//!     no card reaches the graveyard. The synchronous (never-paused) path.
//!  2. `surveil_rest_pile_under_two_redirects_runs_keep_on_top_cleanup_once` — two
//!     simultaneous redirects make every unkept card prompt a CR 616.1 ordering
//!     choice; answering each delivers ALL of them to exile (none stranded), the
//!     parked batch tail fully drains, and the kept-on-top reorder runs exactly
//!     once (the kept card is on top, present exactly once, not duplicated).
