//! Issue #5278 — Vizier of Many Faces Embalm copy panic.
//!
//! Vizier of Many Faces is a 0/0 Clone whose printed replacement lets it enter
//! as a copy of any creature, "except if this creature was embalmed, the token
//! has no mana cost, it's white, and it's a Zombie in addition to its other
//! types." Its Embalm ability synthesizes an activated ability that creates a
//! token that's a copy of Vizier (`CopyTokenOf { target: SelfRef,
//! additional_modifications: [SetColor White, RemoveManaCost, AddSubtype Zombie] }`).
//!
//! Because Vizier's copiable values carry its OWN "enter as a copy" replacement,
//! the freshly created Embalm token pauses at `ReplacementChoice` (accept the
//! enter-as-copy) and then `CopyTargetChoice` (pick a creature to copy). On
//! accept, the liminal branch of `handle_copy_target_choice` resolves
//! `BecomeCopy` (copying the chosen creature onto the token) and then had to
//! apply the Embalm copy exceptions.
//!
//! THE BUG (pre-fix): the exceptions were re-applied as a `Duration::Permanent`
//! LAYERED transient continuous effect. `RemoveManaCost` is a stamp-only copy
//! exception (CR 707.9b — copy "except" clauses are part of the token's
//! COPIABLE values, not a layered effect), so the layer pass hit
//! `unreachable!("RemoveManaCost is consumed at copy resolution; never layered")`
//! and PANICKED.
//!
//! THE FIX: fold the Embalm exceptions into the `BecomeCopy` ability's own
//! `additional_modifications` before it resolves, so `become_copy::resolve`
//! (the single authority) CONSUMES `RemoveManaCost` into the copy's copiable
//! values (CR 707.9b) and layers the remaining CR 613.1 continuous copy
//! exceptions atop the `CopyValues` clone — never layering the stamp-only
//! `RemoveManaCost`. On revert (re-applying the exceptions as a separate
//! `Duration::Permanent` transient), the accept case panics again.
