//! MSH Wave 1 — `TriggerMode::Connives` ("whenever [subject] connives").
//!
//! Building-block coverage for the connive-payoff class: Glorious Purpose, Iron
//! Monger (Sadistic Tycoon), and Ultron, Unlimited all carry a "whenever a
//! creature you control connives" / self-connive trigger. These cards are not in
//! the local test fixture (MSH is release-gated), so the tests drive the real
//! parser + trigger pipeline through representative Oracle text.

//! CR 701.50f: a permanent "connives" after the connive process completes; the

//! 701.50b LKI), not the causing source — otherwise "whenever a creature you
