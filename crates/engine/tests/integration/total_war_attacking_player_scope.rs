//! Total War (Ice Age) — "Whenever a player attacks with one or more creatures,
//! destroy all untapped non-Wall creatures that player controls that didn't
//! attack, except for creatures the player hasn't controlled continuously since
//! the beginning of the turn."
//!
//! Misparse-backlog category #9 ("Wrong player/controller scope"): the "that
//! player controls" clause in the effect body must bind to the ATTACKING player
//! (the triggering-event player), not to Total War's own controller. Before the
//! fix, `relative_player_scope_for_condition` had no arm for the
//! "a player attacks with" head-noun trigger, so the DestroyAll filter defaulted
//! to `You` — Total War would destroy its OWN controller's creatures.
//!
//! The fix adds `condition_introduces_attacking_player` →
//! `ControllerRef::TriggeringPlayer`; at runtime `extract_player_from_event`'s
//! `AttackersDeclared` arm resolves that to the attacking player
//! (CR 508.1 + CR 603.2c).
//!
//! Fixture is designed so the intentionally-out-of-scope continuity exemption
//! ("except for creatures the player hasn't controlled continuously ...", a
//! separately-tracked dropped-clause gap) never changes the expected result:
//! every creature is placed pre-existing (entered a prior turn, via
//! `add_creature`), so it would be exempt under NO reading of the clause.
