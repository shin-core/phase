//! Issue #3277: Captain N'ghathrod's end-step reanimation must not prompt
//! after the milled opponent has left the game.
//!
//! When an opponent is eliminated (CR 800.4a), their zones leave the game before
//! "at the beginning of your end step" resolves. N'ghathrod must not offer a
//! target in that eliminated player's graveyard.
//!
