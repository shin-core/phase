//! Phase C4 (zone-change pipeline) discriminating tests for the
//! mass-bounce-honors-Moved-redirect bug-fix.
//!
//! Before Phase C4, `bounce::resolve_all` delivered each mass-bounced permanent
//! with a bare `zones::move_to_zone(state, obj_id, destination, events)` under a
//! per-site comment claiming "no replacement-pipeline detour is needed because
//! mass-bounce events are not destruction events (CR 614.6 doesn't apply here)".
//! That justification was wrong by citation: CR 614.6 governs replacement
//! semantics generally, and CR 614.1 replacements watch zone-change *events*,
//! not only destruction. The raw move never proposed a per-object `ZoneChange`,
//! so `Moved` redirects watching the bounce destination ("if a creature would be
//! returned to a hand, exile it instead" class) were silently dropped. (PLAN §8
//! Risk #4.)
//!
//! Phase C4 routes the mass bounce through the shared
//! `zone_pipeline::move_objects_simultaneously` batch entry, which proposes each
//! inner `ZoneChange` and consults the `Moved` replacements before delivery.
//!
//! Two tests:
//!  1. `mass_bounce_honors_to_hand_redirect` — the discriminating test: a single
//!     "returned to hand -> exile instead" redirect sends every bounced creature
//!     to EXILE, not the hand. FAILS on the old raw `move_to_zone`.
//!  2. `mass_bounce_under_two_redirects_delivers_every_permanent_through_choices`
//!     — the pause/resume test: two simultaneous redirects make every bounced
//!     creature prompt a CR 616.1 ordering choice; answering each must deliver
//!     ALL of them (none stranded) and fully drain the parked batch tail.
