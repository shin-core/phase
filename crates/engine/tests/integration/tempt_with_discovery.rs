//! Integration tests for the Tempting Offer cycle (Tempt with Discovery, Glory,
//! Immortality, Reflections, Vengeance — Commander 2013). The cycle shares a
//! "you do X, each opponent may do X, then for each opponent who took the offer
//! you do X again" shape; the "for each opponent who [verbed] this way" step
//! is the architectural crux.
//!
//! GitHub issue #132: "Playing tempt with discovery gives you the first tutor,
//! the opponents tutor, but you don't get to tutor for each opponent that did
//! so." This file pins the parser-level shape; the engine round-trip is
//! covered by `tempt_with_discovery_engine.rs`.
