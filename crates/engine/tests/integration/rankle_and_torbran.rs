//! Rankle and Torbran — runtime coverage for the third modal mode's global
//! damage-boost replacement: "If a source would deal damage to a player or battle
//! this turn, it deals that much damage plus 2 instead."
//!
//! The parser emits this as an `Effect::AddTargetReplacement` with
//! `target: TargetFilter::None` carrying a `ReplacementDefinition` with
//! `damage_modification: Plus { value: 2 }`, `damage_target_filter: Player { Any }`,
//! NO `damage_source_filter` (the clause is "a source", i.e. *any* source), and
//! `expiry: EndOfTurn` (verified against `client/public/card-data.json`'s parsed
//! `triggers` for "rankle and torbran").
//!
//! Because the source clause is "a source" (not "a source you control"), this
//! mode carries no controller-relative `damage_source_filter` and was therefore
//! NOT broken by the `ObjectId(0)` controller bug the `source_controller` anchor
//! fixes — its match path never consults a source controller. These tests are
//! runtime coverage for the boost itself (boost any source dealing damage to a
//! player; never boost damage dealt to a permanent), confirming the anchor change
//! does not regress the any-source class. They drive the install path
//! (`add_target_replacement::resolve`) and the apply path (`replace_event`).
