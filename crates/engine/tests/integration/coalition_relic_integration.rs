//! Integration tests for Coalition Relic, third ability — issue #130.
//!
//! Oracle (third ability):
//!   At the beginning of your precombat main phase, you may remove all charge
//!   counters from ~. If you do, add one mana of any color for each charge
//!   counter removed this way.
//!
//! These tests pin the chain that issue #130 demonstrated as broken at
//! resolution time (the user reports the third ability "doesn't trigger").
//! The fix is composed of three small extensions:
//!
//!   1. `oracle_quantity::parse_for_each_clause` maps "[counter] removed this
//!      way" to `QuantityRef::PreviousEffectAmount` (instead of falling through
//!      to `TrackedSetSize`, which would always be 1 for self-counter removal).
//!   2. `oracle_effect/mana.rs` extends the "mana of any color" branch to
//!      consume a trailing "for each X" clause and build
//!      `ManaProduction::AnyOneColor { count: QuantityExpr::Ref { qty }, .. }`.
//!   3. `effects/mod.rs` derives `last_effect_amount` from the parent effect's
//!      semantic event class, so `Effect::RemoveCounter` reads
//!      `GameEvent::CounterRemoved { count, .. }` (CR 608.2c + CR 122.1).
//!
//! The trigger-AST shape (parser-level) is verified in
//! `parser::oracle_trigger::tests::trigger_coalition_relic_charge_counter_drain`.
//! These tests verify the runtime resolution: the parent
//! `Effect::RemoveCounter` removes N counters and the child sub-ability sees
//! N as `PreviousEffectAmount`.
//!
//! The "you may" outer prompt is engine plumbing already covered by other
//! optional-effect tests (e.g., madame_null_integration). These tests bypass
//! that prompt to isolate the new behavior — the charge-counter drain plus
//! the dynamic-count any-color mana production.
