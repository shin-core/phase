//! Regression: GitHub issue #406 — The Wise Mothman ("Whenever one or more
//! nonland cards are milled, …") and the broader milled-trigger class.
//!
//! Bug: the Oracle parser never emitted `TriggerMode::Milled` for any
//! "…cards are milled" / "…mills a card" condition. Every milled-trigger card
//! (The Wise Mothman, Glowing One, Infesting Radroach, Mirelurk Queen,
//! Screeching Scorchbeast, Zellix Sanity Flayer) parsed its mill trigger to
//! `TriggerMode::Unknown`, so the trigger never fired even though the runtime
//! matcher (`game/trigger_matchers.rs::match_milled`) was already correct.
//!
//! Fix: `parser/oracle_trigger.rs::try_parse_event` now recognizes both the
//! passive ("are milled") and active ("mills <object>") mill predicates and
//! emits `TriggerMode::Milled` (CR 701.17a). The "one or more …" batched
//! semantics are stamped by the existing caller plumbing (`def.batched`).
//!
//! These tests drive a *real* mill through `apply` — a Tome Scour spell
//! ("Target player mills five cards") resolves and produces genuine
//! `ZoneChanged { from: Library, to: Graveyard }` events — and assert the
//! milled trigger fires as a consequence. No synthetic `GameEvent` is injected.
