//! Regression (issue #2722): a `MatchEachFilter` library search must not
//! DEADLOCK (game freeze) when the library can't supply one card per filter
//! slot.
//!
//! Aang's Journey, kicked, searches the library for "a basic land card and a
//! Shrine card". A deck with basics but NO Shrine cannot fill the Shrine slot.
//! Pre-fix, the `SearchChoice` submission guard required EXACTLY `count` cards
//! satisfying `MatchEachFilter`, and the AI candidate generator only enumerated
//! `count`-sized combinations — so against a no-Shrine library every candidate
//! was filtered out, the legal-action set was EMPTY, and the game froze with no
//! submittable action.
//!
//! CR 701.23b: when searching a hidden zone for cards with a stated quality, a
//! player "isn't required to find some or all of those cards even if they're
//! present" — a stated-quality search may ALWAYS fail to find some or all of the
//! described cards (CR 701.23b), distinct from a pure-quantity search which must
//! find as many as possible (CR 701.23d).
//!
//! This drives the REAL pipeline: `search_library::resolve` parks the live
//! `WaitingFor::SearchChoice`, the AI candidate enumerator (`candidate_actions_
//! broad`) must return a non-empty legal-action set, and the real engine
//! submission handler (`apply_as_current` → `engine_resolution_choices`) accepts
//! both a single-basic partial pick and the empty full-fail-to-find. The
//! `SearchLibrary → ChangeZone(Hand) → Shuffle` continuation moves the found
//! card to hand and shuffles, mirroring the real card's resolution chain.
//!
//! This is NOT an AST-shape test. Pre-fix it fails at the `candidate_actions_
//! broad` non-empty assertion (empty legal-action set == freeze) and at the
//! submission `.expect(...)` (the guard rejects the short pick).
