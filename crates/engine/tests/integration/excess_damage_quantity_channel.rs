//! CR 120.10 — the EXCESS damage channel of the previous-effect quantity.
//!
//! `DamageChannel` existed, `GameState::last_effect_excess_amount` existed and was
//! already stamped by the damage effects, and the CONDITION peer
//! (`AbilityCondition::PreviousEffectAmount { channel: Excess }`, "if excess damage
//! was dealt this way") already read it. Only the QUANTITY side was missing:
//! `QuantityRef::PreviousEffectAmount` was a bare unit variant with no channel, so
//! it could only ever read the TOTAL (`last_effect_amount`).
//!
//! The consequence was not a wrong number — it was a dropped clause. With no way to
//! type "the amount of excess damage dealt to that creature this way", the whole
//! surrounding instruction fell to an honest red:
//!
//!   Goblin Negotiation  "Create ... 1/1 red Goblin creature tokens equal to the
//!                        amount of excess damage dealt to that creature this way."
//!   Hell to Pay         (same shape, tapped Treasures)
//!   Lacerate Flesh      (same shape, Blood tokens)
//!   Contest of Claws    "... discover X, where X is that excess damage."
//!
//! and one face was WORSE than a red — Archaic's Agony ("Exile cards from the top of
//! your library equal to the excess damage dealt to that creature this way") parsed
//! GREEN to a `ChangeZone` with NO COUNT AT ALL. The quantity was silently swallowed
//! and the card rendered as fully supported.
//!
//! These are RUNTIME witnesses: each parses the card's real Oracle clause through the
//! production parser and hands the resulting `QuantityExpr` to the live resolver
//! against a state where excess damage was actually dealt.
//!
//! Oracle text below is read from the card export, not from memory.
