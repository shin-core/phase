//! CR 608.2h + CR 113.7a + CR 111.7 + CR 603.4: a `SourceMatchesFilter`
//! intervening-if must still be answerable when the triggered ability's SOURCE has
//! ceased to exist.
//!
//! Oracle text (Dreampod Druid — 2/2 creature, verbatim):
//!   "At the beginning of each upkeep, if this creature is enchanted, create a 1/1
//!    green Saproling creature token."
//!
//! WHY THIS CARD. Of the 65 faces in the pool carrying a
//! `TriggerCondition::SourceMatchesFilter` intervening-if, 62 have an effect that acts
//! only on the SOURCE (pair it / it becomes an N/N creature / put a counter on it /
//! transform it / return it to hand / shuffle it in / suspect it). Once the source is
//! gone those effects are inert no matter what the condition answers, so the condition's
//! answer is unobservable and cannot be witnessed at all. Dreampod Druid is the one face
//! in the class whose gate is source-referential while its EFFECT acts on the game — it
//! creates a token — so the condition's answer is directly observable as a board change.
//! (Whiplash, Vengeful Engineer is the near-miss: its effect is observable too, but its
//! `X = the number of Equipment attached to him` also reads the attachment set, so it
//! needs a second fix. Taigam, Ojutai Master looks like a candidate but is a LYING GREEN
//! — its `that spell gains rebound` grant never lands on the stack object even with a
//! living source, so it cannot witness anything. Filed separately.)
//!
//! THE DEFECT. The `SourceMatchesFilter` arm (`check_trigger_condition`, triggers.rs)
//! asks the filter about the SOURCE ITSELF as the subject. t73 (PR #5779) repaired the
//! CONTEXT half of this class — the source's CONTROLLER now answers from LKI. The
//! SUBJECT half remained: `filter_inner` looks the subject up in `state.objects`, and a
//! token that left the battlefield ceased to exist (CR 111.7 / CR 704.5d) and was purged
//! from `state.objects` outright. The filter cannot see the subject at all, so it fails
//! closed for EVERY property.
//!
//! Worse, the property this card gates on could not be answered even once the subject was
//! visible: attachment is a battlefield-only relationship, and SBA unattaches everything
//! the instant the host leaves (CR 704.5m/n), so the live board has nothing left to read.
//! `LKISnapshot` did not capture the attachment set, and the LKI→`ZoneChangeRecord`
//! synthesizer hardcoded `attachments: vec![]`. Both halves are needed: the subject must
//! be visible via LKI, AND the LKI must actually carry what the filter asks for.
//!
//! CR 608.2h is explicit that fail-closed is wrong here: "If the effect requires
//! information from a specific object, INCLUDING THE SOURCE OF THE ABILITY ITSELF, the
//! effect uses the current information of that object if it's in the public zone it was
//! expected to be in; if it's no longer in that zone ... the effect uses the object's
//! LAST KNOWN INFORMATION." And CR 113.7a: "Once activated or triggered, an ability
//! exists on the stack independently of its source. Destruction or removal of the source
//! after that time won't affect the ability."
//!
//! THE DISCRIMINATING VECTOR IS THE CR 111.7 PURGE. A nontoken Druid that dies stays in
//! `state.objects` (graveyard), so the subject is still visible to `filter_inner` — but
//! its attachments are gone either way, so BOTH legs need the LKI attachment capture.
//! Both are asserted below.
//!
//! This drives the REAL pipeline end to end: the card is synthesized from verbatim Oracle
//! text, the Aura is attached through the engine's `attach::attach_to` authority, the
//! upkeep trigger fires off the real phase machinery, the source is killed through the
//! real zone-change pipeline (`move_to_zone`, which snapshots LKI) and purged by the real
//! SBA (`check_state_based_actions`), and the trigger resolves off the real stack. The
//! observable is the number of Saproling tokens on the battlefield.
