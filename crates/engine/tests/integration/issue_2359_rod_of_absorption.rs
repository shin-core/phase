//! Regression: GitHub issue #2359 — Rod of Absorption.
//!
//! Oracle:
//!   "Whenever a player casts an instant or sorcery spell, exile it instead of
//!    putting it into a graveyard as it resolves.
//!    {X}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: You may cast any number of spells from
//!    among cards exiled with this artifact with total mana value X or less
//!    without paying their mana costs."
//!
//! Three reported defects:
//!   1. The exile-on-resolve trigger only tracked the controller's spells —
//!      opponents' instants/sorceries were not exiled with Rod.
//!   2. Only one spell was recorded, not all accumulated exiled spells.
//!   3. Activating {X},{T},Sacrifice ignored the exiled cards (no free-cast
//!      offer) yet still sacrificed Rod.
//!
//! CR 614.1a / CR 608.2n: "exile it instead of putting it into a graveyard as it
//! resolves" is a self-replacement rider applied to the resolving spell.
//! CR 607.2b / CR 406.6: cards exiled this way are "exiled with" Rod (a linked-
//! exile pool that ACCUMULATES across resolutions).
//! CR 601.2b / CR 118.9: the activated ability lets the controller cast those
//! exiled cards without paying their mana costs.
