//! Armored Kincaller — `Or`-wrapped performed-gate on an optional ETB trigger.
//!
//! Oracle: "When this creature enters, you may reveal a Dinosaur card from your
//! hand. If you do or if you control another Dinosaur, you gain 3 life."
//!
//! The ETB trigger is `optional` ("you may reveal"); its `GainLife` sub-ability
//! carries the composite condition `Or { [IfYouDo, QuantityCheck(control
//! another Dinosaur)] }`. When the controller DECLINES the optional reveal but
//! controls another Dinosaur, the `Or`'s second disjunct is satisfied, so they
//! must still gain 3 life.
//!
//! Before the fix, `should_resolve_subability_on_optional_decline` classified
//! every `Or`/`And` condition as "not a decline branch" — so on decline the
//! `GainLife` sub-ability was dropped entirely and the player never gained
//! life, even though `QuantityCheck` was true.
//!
//! This drives the real cast -> stack -> ETB trigger -> `OptionalEffectChoice`
//! -> decline pipeline through `resolve()` (the resolution driver declines
//! optional "you may" effects by default — CR 608.2d).
//!
//! CR references (verified against docs/MagicCompRules.txt):
//!   - CR 603.3: once an ability triggers, its controller puts it on the stack.
//!   - CR 608.2c: "the controller follows the ability's instructions in the
//!     order written"; a condition that gates an instruction is evaluated as
//!     the ability resolves.
//!   - CR 608.2d: an effect offering a choice (here the optional "you may
//!     reveal") has the player announce it while applying the effect.
