//! Pipeline regression for **Dromoka's Command** mode 1 + mode 3 — the
//! source-scoped prevention + independent modal `PutCounter` interaction that
//! produced an infinite loop (Shalai and Hallar's "+1/+1 counter → deal damage
//! to opponent" trigger looping when Dromoka's mode-1 prevention shield was
//! fused as a blanket prevent-all whose rider was mode 3's `PutCounter`).
//!
//! Defect A (parser): "Prevent all damage target instant or sorcery spell would
//! deal this turn" dropped the source scope, producing a blanket prevent-all
//! shield (`target: Any`, no `damage_source_filter`).
//!
//! Defect B (resolver/chaining): mode 3's `PutCounter` was fused as mode 1's
//! prevention-shield `runtime_execute`, so the shield intercepted every
//! `DamageDone` event and re-fired the +1/+1 counter — an infinite loop.
//!
//! This test drives the REAL cast pipeline: P0 (the active player) casts a
//! damage instant at itself, holds it on the stack, then casts Dromoka's
//! Command in response — choosing mode 1 (target the instant) and mode 3 (put a
//! +1/+1 counter on P0's creature). It asserts:
//!   * the shield's `damage_source_filter` is `And[SpecificObject, Typed]`
//!     (source-scoped, not blanket);
//!   * the +1/+1 counter lands EXACTLY ONCE on the chosen creature (no loop);
//!   * the prevented spell deals no damage to P0.
//!
//! The wrong-source discrimination (a non-chosen source's damage is NOT
//! prevented) is covered at the resolver level by
//! `source_scoped_shield_only_prevents_chosen_spell_not_other_sources` in
//! `prevent_damage.rs`, which can drive the in-crate damage primitive directly.
//!
//! CR 609.7 + CR 609.7a + CR 615.2 + CR 700.2d.
