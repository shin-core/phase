//! CR 702.104a-b: Tribute pay/decline evaluator.
//!
//! The chosen opponent of a Tribute creature faces a binary choice as it enters:
//!   - Pay: source enters with N +1/+1 counters.
//!   - Decline: the companion "if tribute wasn't paid" trigger fires.
//!
//! The AI must weigh the board-state value of handing out N +1/+1 counters against
//! the harm of letting the declined-tribute trigger resolve. This is a simple
//! heuristic evaluator — not a full `TacticalPolicy` — invoked from the AI's
//! candidate scoring when it faces a `WaitingFor::TributeChoice`.
