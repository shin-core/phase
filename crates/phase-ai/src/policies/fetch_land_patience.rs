//! Fetch-land patience tactical policy.
//!
//! Report (Discord #ai-suggestions): the AI cracks Evolving Wilds the instant
//! it resolves, with no patience. Evolving Wilds ("{T}, Sacrifice this land:
//! Search your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield
//! tapped, then shuffle.") and its class (Terramorphic Expanse, Terminal
//! Moraine, …) sacrifice themselves to fetch a land that enters **tapped**.
//!
//! Because the fetched land enters tapped (CR 305.4 — it is *put* onto the
//! battlefield, not played), cracking the fetch yields **zero mana this turn**.
//! The only payoff is fixing/thinning for a *later* turn. So there is never a
//! same-turn reason to crack early: the patient line is to hold the fetch until
//! the AI's own end step, by which point it has seen the whole turn and knows
//! which basic it actually wants. Cracking earlier gives up that information for
//! no tempo gain.
//!
//! This policy rejects cracking a tapped self-sacrifice land-fetch outside the
//! AI's own end step, and gives a small nudge to crack it *at* the end step (the
//! source produces no mana on its own, so leaving it uncracked strands a dead
//! land). It deliberately ignores untapped true fetchlands (Wooded Foothills,
//! Flooded Strand): those produce mana the turn they are cracked, so early
//! cracking is correct and must not be gated.
