//! Condition-gated activation tactical policy.
//!
//! Report (Discord #ai-suggestions, "Mosswort Bridge"): the AI activates a
//! hideaway land's payoff ability (`{G}, {T}: You may play the exiled card
//! without paying its mana cost if creatures you control have total power 10 or
//! greater`) every turn even when it has far less than 10 power, burning mana
//! and the tap for an effect that does nothing.
//!
//! The engine is rules-correct: per CR 602.5 (and the Shelldock Isle ruling) the
//! hideaway payoff ability is *legal* to activate under the threshold — only the
//! `CastFromZone` effect is gated, and it correctly does nothing at resolution
//! (CR 608.2c) when the condition is false. So this is purely an AI-value miss:
//! paying a cost for an activation whose entire payoff is currently gated off.
//!
//! This penalizes activating any ability whose top-level intervening-if
//! `condition` evaluates false right now, so `PassPriority` (or a better line)
//! wins. It generalizes across the whole class of "Cost: do X if [board
//! condition]" activated abilities — every hideaway land (Shelldock Isle,
//! Windbrisk Heights, Spinerock Knoll, Howltooth Hollow, Mosswort Bridge) and
//! beyond — not a single card.
//!
//! Condition evaluation is delegated to the engine
//! (`ability_condition_currently_met`), which only judges board/controller-
//! relative conditions and returns `None` for anything that needs resolution-time
//! context (chosen targets, the cast/trigger event). A soft penalty (not a hard
//! `Reject`) is used because an ability's *cost* can change the very thing its
//! condition checks (e.g. a sacrifice cost that makes "if you control no
//! creatures" true at resolution); the condition here is read pre-cost, so the
//! AI may still take such a line if strongly favored.
